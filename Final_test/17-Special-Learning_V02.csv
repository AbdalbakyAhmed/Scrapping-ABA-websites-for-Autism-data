How to Stop Talking and Start Communicating with Motivational Interviewing: A Behavior Therapist Guide on How to Effectively Collaborate with Caregivers (RECORDED),"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)
We walk the walk, but do we talk the talk? As clinicians, do we speak with parents or to them? Is it effective in motivating them to adhere to interventions or do you find that sometimes they inhale and exhale at the sight/sound of parent training sessions?Research shows that parents who receive parent training obtain better outcomes out of their children's treatment, decrease their overall expenditures in therapy and become empowered to maintain these behavior changes over time. However, while parents are bringing their children to treatment (which is indicative of their desire to find help, unless of course, they are mandated by court), it is still a challenge to help parents follow through with interventions at home. Without addressing the etiology of parents' non-adherence or lack of consistency in treatment, it is impossible to help them move past these barriers. It has been found that parent and clinician's communication with one another supports whether parents will adhere to treatment. Surprisingly as clinicians in this field, we are not trained on how to effectively communicate with clients. Sure, we learn the theory; we practice and practice some more, and we even read and write about it. But is that enough?A proposed solution for this is Motivational Interviewing which is an empirically proven intervention that has shown substantial success in the literature in changing addictive behaviors in substance users, medication adherence in patients, and training teachers and caregivers on behavior modification techniques for children with developmental disabilities. MI uses change talk strategies to increase cooperation and therefore decrease resistance.",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-615,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/615/image_15976783821250.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II
"Motivational Interviewing: Strategies to Decrease Resistance and Increase Buy-in (LIVE Webinar November 18, 2020)","
APA: 2 General(Home Study)
As clinicians or an educators, how many of you have experienced barriers that get in the way of helping clients or students make progress because of resistance from other members of the treatment (or educational) team? Whether the resistance is from parents, peers, professionals or any other stakeholders, the end result is the same -- the ability to make progress is diminished.Motivational Interviewing is an evidence-based intervention that has demonstrated substantial success in training teachers and caregivers on behavior modification techniques for children with developmental disabilities, changing addictive behaviors in substance users and medication adherence in patients, among others. In short, motivational interviewing uses change talk strategies to increase cooperation and decrease resistance.For clinicians and educators, this is a tool that any clinician and/or educators MUST have in their tool-box. WHY?Research shows that parents who receive parent training obtain better outcomes during their children's treatment, which results in decreasing their overall expenditures in therapy and becoming empowered to maintain these behavior changes over time.It has been found that effective communication between the parent and clinician is directly corelated to a parent's buy-in and ahderence to treatment plans.For clinicians and educators, understanding motivational interviewing is just the beginning. The critical question is HOW?On Wednesday, November 18, 2020, Special Learning, in conjunction with Dr. Monica Gilbert, LMHC, PsyD, BCBA-D, an expert in combining the motivational interviewing strategy with behavioral strategies will share her knowledge and experience to help clinicians and educators remove communication-related barrers that get in the way of progress.LEARNING OBJECTIVES:WEBINAR DETAILS:Date:Wednesday, November 18, 2020

ABA Level 1 (Russian) Session 6: Active Student Responding: Increasing Learner's Motivation and Self-Monitoring,"This 2-hour webcast will provide a review of theory, practice, and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents working with person's with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with adolescents and/or adults with autism and related disorders.How can we increase student motivation, buy-in and responsibility for their own learning and still keep them engaged? According to studies, active student responding can increase student success and can allow students to become more engaged in their own learning as an active participant. The idea behind active student responding is that students become responsible for their own learning by participating in activities on all levels and all students are an equal participant in the learning activities, rather than just the student who is called on or raises his or her hand. This technique has been shown to be successful with students with disabilities as well as typical students (Lerner, 2011). There are many benefits to active student responding including:",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-604,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/604/image_15912041719224.png,$39.99,,Podcast,

Supervision Webinar Training Series: What Makes a Great Supervisor (RECORDED),"We will identify the minimum pre-requisite competencies and personal characteristics Supervisors must possess as a Minimal Viable Clinician (MVC) and... asa “great” supervisor. We will introduce the concept of Minimum Viable Clinician (MVC)... a clinician with the skills and knowledge to be able to effectively deliver quality ABA services across different settings - and how to develop those competencies in order to help shape their supervisees to enable them to reach a level of competence sufficient to credibly and effectively maintain the integrity of the field of behavior analysis.As of July 2019, the field has nearly 100,000 BACB certificants in the world. Of those, 62,000+ are RBTs who require 5% of their hours supervised by a BCBA (or BCaBA and BCBA-D). Due to the explosive growth we’ve seen in the field of behavior analysis, we are experiencing unintended consequences, some of which are leading to degradation in the quality of supervision.

Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessment & Monitoring Tool,"VIDEOThe field of behavior analysis has been undergoing a period of tremendous change. Some of these changes have the potential to transform the field into one of global recognition and standing; whereas other changes can delegitimize all the hard work, dedication and efforts to which the founders of the field and parents of children with autism or related disorders have dedicated their entire lives -- paving the path for the next generation of providers and recipients of ABA intervention.At Special Learning, we have always believed the single greatest factor in ensuring and maintaining quality in the field of behavior analysis is quality supervision! With great supervision, the profession can continue to add Minimal Viable Clinicians™ (MVCs™) who are qualified, competent BCBAs to the field, who in turn, will continue to develop equally qualified, competent BCBAs. Conversely, those pursuing credentialing who received less than quality supervision would then themselves become supervisors and perpetuate the downward spiral in quality service provisions.We believe that understanding the science of behavior has the potential to maximize the benefits of teaching in all situations, including the supervised fieldwork experience. The Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessmentand Monitoring Tool was created to assist supervisors and supervisees in the development and implementation of supervised fieldwork that is truly behavior analytic. As such, the supervised fieldwork experience and its oversight must adhere to the description proposed by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in their 1968 article “Some Current Dimensions of Applied Behavior Analysis”.This tool was designed for supervisors to guide supervisees in meeting mastery criteria to become an effective, ethical and competent Behavior Analyst, as is similar to other curriculum-based assessment tools. This project was in development for 4 years with input from many BCBAs® across the world.By using this system, you will be able to track specific behavior analytic skillsets of your supervisee. These have been identified by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board ® as necessary for behavior analysts, making them applied. The skills are clearly defined in terms that are observable and measurable for supervisors making it possible for this behavior change program to be both behavioral and analytic. This assessment includes supplementary materials for use in supervision activities to promote practice in the necessary skill sets, adding technological elements as well. By incorporating these principles into the supervision process, it is ensured that the supervision experience is conceptually systematic and that supervision is effective and promotes generalization of the skills necessary in the practice of behavior analysis.The Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessment & Monitoring Tool task analyzes (sub-domain) the BACB® Fourth Edition Task List (Task List) and Professional & Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts ® (PECC) by each Task List Item and creates an automated scoring across each sub-domain. In doing so, the Supervisor can analyze the progress of each of their supervisees with ease.

Supervision Considerations for International Markets,"In the 3rd webinar of ourBest Practices in Supervision Series, we will provide an unvarnished look at the challenges of providing behavior analytic supervision in International markets.This webinar, entitled,Supervision Considerations for International Marketswill review how the current condition – critical shortage of International BCBAs – is affecting the availability and quality of supervision being provided to BCBA candidates, BCaBAs and RBTs outside the U.S. We will provide a brief review of Section 5.0 of the BACB Ethics Code and examine required modification to the code, reasons behind the modifications, and short-term and long-term implications to the field.Is it well known that in International markets ethics-related issues are rampant. Severe lack of resources and limited understanding of ABA pose significantly greater challenges than in the U.S., the most severe of those being financially-driven predatory behavior. With our panelists, we will review real ethical scenarios submitted by International BCBAs and engage in a dialogue about the impact on the quality of care given current market conditions.

Realities of BCBA Supervision,"CEU: 2BACB Supervision or Type II(Included with purchase)CEU: 2 QABA® General (Included with purchase)What are the realities of Supervision for BCBAs and BCaBA? Depending on the quality of the supervisor andthe supervisee, it can be the BEST or WORST experience in one's profession.Why is supervision important? Supervision is one of the most important elements of maintaining quality in the field of ABA. BCBA-Ds, BCBAs, and BCaBAs who take on the challenge of supervision are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the next generation of Behavior Analysts and RBTs have the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve excellence in outcomes. Not only is this important in terms of providing quality services to consumers, keep in mind that every BCBA-D, BCBA, BCaBA or RBT, as a representative of the field, has the ability and responsibility to maintain the integrity and legitimacy of the profession of ABA, which many would agree is still in its infancy.In the 2nd Webinar of our Best Practices in Supervision Series, we took an honest and unvarnished look at the realities of what happens during supervision. As a follow up to our webinar, the Realities of Supervisionwebinar explored the realities, including blunders, that occur during behavior analytic supervision.The webinar used actual case scenarios submitted by BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs and BCBA Candidates around the world to discuss positive and negative experiences to identify strategies and guidelines to ensure a positive supervision experience.

Ensuring Treatment Integrity,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study) ---NOTE: ONLY AVAILABLE FOR RECORDED WEBINARSThis 120-minute webcast provides an overview of the use of applied behavior analytic principles to increase data accuracy and treatment fidelity while teaching techniques to gain staff buy-in.

Data collection may be considered the cornerstone of applied behavior analysis. Data determines how behavior analysts make decisions about behavioral interventions. Data is often collected by other staff, not necessarily behavior analysts. Behavior analysts therefore must ensure that the collected data is accurate and reliable. Staff must also be trained to implement interventions with fidelity. Common issues in the full implementation of behavior interventions involve inaccurate data recording, observer/""implementation"" drift, and inaccurate implementation of behavioral interventions.

Staff training begins at an organizational, macro-level to ensure the availability of resources. In the field of applied behavior analysis, particularly in work involving individuals with disabilities, job positions at all levels may be stressful. The amount of work needed for the care of individuals with a disability can be daunting. Implementing behavioral strategies with fidelity is crucial to ensure accurate analysis of interventions and prevent staff from engaging in ineffective behavioral interventions.

This presentation will discuss the components of effective behavioral intervention: accurate implementation of behavioral strategies, data collection, and methods to increase staff buy-in and decrease staff burnout. A review of the literature will be explored to identify effective methods for implementing all components of an effective behavioral intervention.Outcomes:

Upon completion of Ensuring Treatment Integrity, participants will be able to:This recorded webcast will total 120 minutes and include a review of practice and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABAs and BCBAs working with persons with Autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with children with Autism and related disorders.Each purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note: DISCLOSURE:

Video Modeling and Video Prompting as a Treatment Intervention,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)This 120-minute  webcast will review a variety of video prompting and video modeling interventions that have shown to be successful in the treatment of autism. It is designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCaBA's and BCBA's working with persons with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff and other professionals working with persons with autism, Asperger's and related disorders.Picture this. While watching a TV show, a young child viewed something they had never seen before: On the show, the cartoon characters make instruments from things they find around the house. They collect their materials and make a ""drum"" out of a coffee tin, a ""horn"" from a paper towel roll, and a ""cymbal"" using 2 pot covers. The characters begin to practice and then decide to have a concert for family and friends. They create a stage and place chairs out for the audience. Upon viewing this scene, the young child finds a paper towel roll and begins to play the ""horn."" He gives his older sister a tin can and tells her that she can be the drummer. He tells his parents to sit down on the couch while he and his sister perform.

The above scenario demonstrates the impact that watching videos can have on one's behavior. In this specific example, the individual had never been reinforced for making and playing instruments in the past. He was not exposed to the environment in vivo and no specific teaching strategies were utilized to increase this behavior. All his learning resulted from viewing the TV show. This is an example of a video model, teaching a variety of skills such as sociodramatic play and peer interaction, just to name a few. Using videos as teaching tools can help to increase a large array of behaviors and skills as well as decrease unwanted behaviors.

Research has shown that utilizing video models and video prompts have been shown to be effective in behavior change for individuals with autism. There are many benefits to utilizing this type of teaching strategy. Increasing communication, downtime skills, and social skills are only a few of the behaviors that can be impacted. In order to use a model to teach new behaviors, individuals must have pre-requisite skills including the ability to attend to a model and imitate actions. If unable to demonstrate these skills, the individual must first master these prerequisites prior to exposure to model prompting procedures (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007).Outcomes:

Upon completion of Video Modeling and Video Prompting as a treatment intervention, participants will:Note:DISCLOSURE:

The Use of Preference Assessments in Applied Settings,"BACB CEU: 1 Type-IIThis 60-minute  webcast provides an overview of the use of preference assessments in applied settings with individuals with developmental disabilities.

The use of reinforcement is vital when acquiring, maintaining, and eliminating operant behaviors (Pace et al.,1985). However, identifying the preferences and reinforcers of individuals with severe intellectual disabilities can be challenging. Researchers have recently examined the methodological rigor of preference assessments and several studies have demonstrated the results of preference assessments to be effective at identifying reinforcers (DeLeon & Iwata, 1996; Fisher et al., 1992). For these reasons, training direct care staff on how to conduct preference assessments is important (Roscoe & Fisher, 2008).

This presentation will provide a brief review of the literature on preference assessments and discuss different formats and various stimuli used. Following, a demonstration on how to conduct the multiple-stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessment will be provided, walking you through how to collect stimuli, implement the assessment, and score the results. Additionally, we will review how to use the results as part of your planning and treatment.This  webcast will enable participants to:Note:DISCLOSURE:

Cultural Competency and Its Application within the Autism Community for Social Workers,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study) ---NOTE: ONLY AVAILABLE FOR RECORDED WEBINARSThis 120-minute webinar addresses the role culture, in its various forms, plays in social work practices with persons with autism and/or their families. This community comes with a unique set of values, beliefs, norms, shared experiences, challenges, and more. We will explore our need as social workers to attain cultural competence around this community and their specific needs in order to achieve best practices in linking clients with natural supports, helping them navigate to find appropriate therapies and treatments, and providing direct therapy and treatment ourselves.Often, families are provided some case management support in the social work environment and are not linked with the benefits of traditional social work therapy and counseling services may bring. There appear to be several possible reasons for this, but most strikingly, we find many professionals and families categorize autism as a developmental disability and not a mental illness. Autism is an Axis 1 diagnosis in the DSM-IV, and literature indicates therapy and counseling based on behavioral theory is effective in decreasing symptoms and problem behavior as well as training new skills. Given our skills sets and additional understanding of autism and treatments, we explore ways we can benefit the family and/or client with autism within a social work context.This event is designed for Licensed Social Workers, Licensed Independent Social Workers, and other professionals in related disciplines.

Upon completion of Cultural Competency and Its Application with the Autism Community, participants will:1. Gain an understanding of the unique challenges and difficulties people with autism and their families face and how professionals can assist them in overcoming these barriers in a culturally sensitive manner.
2. Learn the various systems people with autism and their families navigate to gain support, treatments, and obtain services.
3. Achieve a better understanding of the additional skills needed to work effectively with individuals with autism and their families and how personal biases, expectations and limited understanding of individuals’ needs can hinder effective treatment.Each purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note:License/Access code can be activated within 3 months from the time of purchase.You have 30 days to access the webcast from the date you activated your access code.DISCLOSURE:

Active Student Responding: Increasing Learner's Motivation and Self-Monitoring,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)This 2-hour webcast will provide a review of theory, practice, and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABA's and BCBA's working with person's with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with adolescents and/or adults with autism, Asperger's and related disorders.How can we increase student motivation, buy-in, and responsibility for their own learning and still keep them engaged? According to studies, active student responding can increase student success and can allow students to become more engaged in their own learning as an active participant. The idea behind active student responding is that students become responsible for their own learning by participating in activities on all levels and all students are an equal participant in the learning activities, rather than just the student who is called on or raises his or her hand. This technique has been shown to be successful with students with disabilities as well as typical students (Lerner, 2011). There are many benefits to active student responding including:Active student responding has been tried at many different grade levels, including college and in training programs as well, with good results Colbert, 2005). When using active student responding, there are many different techniques that instructors can use to actively engage all the students. Instructors are encouraged to be creative in thinking of ways to facilitate student participation and ownership.

Some types of active student responding activities are:There are many other interesting ways to enhance student participation using these techniques. Instructors are encouraged to be creative in thinking of ways to facilitate student participation and ownership of their learning.
In addition to the actual techniques involved in active student responding, instructors should be familiar with the benefits of this teaching method and how this strategy increases learning and decreases problematic behavior.

ADHD Assessment and Diagnosis Across Settings,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 11% of American children have an Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) / Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. While an estimated 30% and 50% of people with Autism are also diagnosed with ADHD, this is a condition that affects the lives of children, adolescents, and adults, with or without developmental disabilities -- located in all walks of life.ADD and ADHD is a condition that can be effectively managed with the use of proper strategies. Evidence has shown that by using a proper combination of medication management and behavioral strategies, persons with ADD/ADHD can be given an opportunity to achieve their highest level of functioning. But what constitutes “proper combination?” How do you monitor this? Does this change over time? Like any other condition, early detection and intervention are key to future success. In our ADD/ADHD LIVE Webinar series with Dr. Ronald T. Brown, a renowned ADHD expert, we will demystify the mystery of ADD/ADHD so that parents, teachers, clinicians, and other care providers can learn about medication and behavioral strategies to help individuals with ADD/ADHD reach their greatest level of functioning.Each 2-hour webinar will address an aspect of ADD/ADHD. Starting our Series with Assessment and Diagnosis, we will take a holistic look at this complex condition with the goal of providing simple, actionable ADD/ADHD management strategies that can be implemented across all settings - home, school, and clinic.This webinar will cover the following topics:Date of LIVE Event:Thursday, March 14, 2019

ADHD Strategies: Family Training and Involvement (RECORDED),"
(APA)2 General(Home Study)In our 5th and final installment in the ADHD Webinar Series, we provided a structural foundation for Family Training... and Involvement. Through real-life scenarios and examples, we explored the importance of family training and identify key components to a successful family training program.Many clinicians work with the Autism population. Oftentimes, we find that the person we work with has a dual-diagnosis of ADHD.

Intro to Strategies to Increase Beginner Classroom Participation Skills,"CEs: 2 Type-II(Included with purchase)CEs: 2 QABA® General (Included with purchase)This 120-minute webinar will identify beginning classroom behaviors that all children must possess to be successful in a group environment and specific strategies to help achieve these skills for children with autism and other special needs.Based upon literature review and successful practice in the real world we will look at the possible functions behind common problem behaviors such as off-task, out of the seat, interrupting, and difficult transitions as well as quick and easy strategies one can implement to change behavior. Incorporating basic ABA procedures, analyzing the environment for possible modifications, teaching replacement behaviors, and incorporating visual strategies are just some of the options we will consider.

Many teachers and professionals are already aware evidence indicate intensive early intervention for at least 2 years during preschool results in improved outcomes for persons with autism and related disorders (NIMH, pg. 14). As part of the Intensive Behavioral Intervention (IBI) model, basic behavior analysis procedures like reinforcement are applied to increase successful social interaction and communication skills. However, studies that describe this level of intensity in well-controlled clinical environments can seem overwhelming, and many times cause frustration and perhaps be dismissed by that outside of the experimental world because it seems unfair and unlike the daily life we live where things may be unpredictable and ever-changing.In the world of behavior analysis this has gained much outward attention and discussion over the years where, as we all learn from the very beginning in ABA, a worthy intervention should, among other things, be one that possesses both social validity and the ability to transfer its technology. Simply speaking, transferring technology is the ability for someone else to take a given method and duplicate it.Excitingly, studies have also demonstrated it is possible to successfully implement behavior change strategies within our real-world classrooms using key components of IBI (Grindle, et.al) such as positive reinforcement, task analysis, discrete trial teaching, generalization, functional behavior assessments, and more. In addition, the literature supports the use of visual strategies, environmental supports, and peer training (Garrison-Harrell, Kamps and Kravits, 1997). These procedures can translate into the real-world classrooms and environments the majority of us spend our time.Our Webinar Series will look in detail at key components to incorporate in the classroom with the goal of helping you increase a child’s appropriate classroom behavior and time in the inclusive environment.

While providing real-life examples of success and difficulties we will focus on strategies you can implement today as we study specific classroom behaviors from assessment to successful behavior change procedure implementation. Each event will total 100 minutes with a review of practice and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABA’s and BCBA’s working and consulting in schools, and other professionals working in a classroom environment with children with autism and related disorders.Outcomes:Upon completion of Strategies to Increase Beginner Classroom Participation Skills: Where to Start, participants will:1. Name key components of comprehensive assessment around 7 common problem classroom behaviors
2. Create a variety of both individual and class-wide reinforcement programs
3. Identify visual strategies to increase/teach appropriate classroom behavior

Severe Problem Behavior,"CEs: 2 Type-II(Included with purchase)CEs: 2 QABA® General (Included with purchase)APA: 2 General (Home Study)How prevalent is severe problem behavior in people with autism and what we as professionals can do to facilitate the lessening of these behaviors to maximize learning and community participation? This webcast will focus on defining what severe problem behavior looks like, evidence-based treatments that have been successful to reduce different types of severe problem behavior, and discussion and case studies of effective and ineffective strategies. Some of the challenging behaviors this webcast will look at are:

• Pica
• Masturbation
• Severe assaultive behavior and aggression
• Severe self-injurious behavior
• Verbal threats, including suicidal ideation
• Other behaviors of concern

A large part of any behavior modification program is a good behavior support plan. This ensures that behavior change procedures are being conducted in an ethical and consistent fashion, no matter who is providing the service. This webcast will also explore how to write a clear and concise behavior support plan and what types of data should be collected as a behavior change strategy is implemented.

Other topics we will be discussing within this recorded webcast include:• How can you tell if the behavior change strategy you are using is ineffective and what can you do about that?
• What research is being done on effective treatment for different types of severe problem behavior and what types of treatments have empirical evidence to show they are effective interventions?
• How can you utilize the function of severe problem behavior as a treatment strategy?
• Case examples and real clinical data that show treatments which were effective in practice as well as some that were not.

Outcomes:
Upon completion of Severe Problem Behavior, participants will:1. Understand what severe problem behavior looks like in a clinical setting and what treatments have shown some efficacy in reducing different types of challenging behavior.
2. Understand how to write a clear and concise behavior plan that addresses the target behavior, yet also serves as a guideline for behavior change for those who work with an individual with severe problem behavior.
3. Identify examples of severe problem behavior and some of the treatments that are effective in reducing problem behavior.Each purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note: DISCLOSURE:

Transition Survival 104: Vocational Topics and Job Coaching,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study) ---NOTE: ONLY AVAILABLE FOR RECORDED WEBINARSUnemployment in the United States has been higher lately with the current economic situation. Unemployment for people with autism continues to hover around the 50-75% level (Hendricks, 2010), therefore it is imperative that we, as professionals, make sure we are doing everything possible to assist individuals with autism in finding meaningful employment that highlights their strengths, gives them a productive way to make a living wage and allows them to participate in work that they find enjoyable and important.

There are several challenges and barriers that people with autism face as they enter the world of work, including communication challenges, behavioral issues, cognitive difficulties, and an employment environment that doesn't always understand the supports people with autism need to enhance their work performance. People with co-morbid conditions or who are more cognitively challenged face even more barriers to employment (Hendricks, 2010).

Some of these are:And many other skills and supports, including both natural and external supports.People with autism often learn differently and may require a different level of vocational training and support system. Because people with autism have varying strengths, challenges, and cognitive abilities, it is crucial that, in order to help them learn, practice, and appropriately generalize skills needed for them to be successful in the vocational environment, a thorough assessment is done that includes the job seeker with autism so he or she can provide input about what types of work he or she would like to engage in. It is also important to encourage the job seeker's self-awareness of his or her strengths, gifts, and differences to empower the job seeker, while helping establish his or her motivation to succeed.Other topics we will be discussing within this webcast include:Outcomes:

Transition Survival 102: Principal Skills to Assess and Learn for Successful Transition,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)Now that we have mastered the tenets of what is needed and accessible to individuals with autism and disabilities from our Transition Survival 101 training, we will look at how to develop solid goals and objectives in a transition plan using specific tools and assessments to aid in this process. This 120-minute webcast begins with a review of the well-studied, principal, critical skills every person needs to survive independently in our world. These skills are not specific to a disability, mental illness, or cognitive function, but simply a breakdown of what all persons need in their behavioral repertoire to independently function in our community today. This list is important to consider when planning for living arrangements, post-secondary education, vocational placement, and community integration for persons with autism.

While most would agree on the basic and functional skills needed to be taught, we must also recognize there are unique challenges that need be considered when analyzing, planning and designing a transition program for adolescents and adults with autism such as, and in no particular order:Now, with a combination of further education, functional tools and assessments, and successful behavior analytic strategies, you will have a set of guidelines and curriculum to implement early and throughout the transition planning phase of treatment.This will total 120 minutes with a review of practice and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABAs and BCBAs working with persons with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with children with autism and related disorders.Note:DISCLOSURE:

Transition Survival 103: Advanced Social Skills for Adolescent and Adults - Part 2,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study) ---NOTE: ONLY AVAILABLE FOR RECORDED WEBINARSHow do you deal with situations.like adjusting to change? Are you always willing to try something new? What do you do when you have to make a very important decision? How do you problem solve? How do you deal with mistakes? Have you ever asked someone out on a date? How did you feel? According to Baker (2005), appropriate social behavior is a subjective process. How people behave in a social situation depends, not only on the people involved, but on what the situation calls for as appropriate.When reviewing the questions above, we identify there are cognitive processes required such as learning self-regulation techniques and understanding relationships in order to respond appropriately in social situations. We will identify these necessary skills and look at strategies that can be taught during early treatment. Strategies that are taught in order to increase these skills will assist in the way individuals act with others. Teaching and learning these skills can include role modeling, lots of practice, and developing opportunities to use these skills often in daily interactions.

For example, some of the social skills we will be reviewing in this webcast are as follows:
This is only a partial list of the skills needed to be a successful adult in society. As professionals, it is important that we find effective ways to teach these skills so that learners will be proficient at these skills. Knowing what to do and when to do it in a social situation not only lessens the possibility of stigma, it also increases independence and success in daily life.Outcomes:

Transition Survival 101: How and When to Create a Transition Plan,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)Increasingly in the recent 20-30 years, children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been fortunate to receive behavior intervention and other treatments throughout their childhood to help prepare them with skills for independent living, increased education opportunities, and even job placements. As autism continually becomes more prominent we see some disciplines, such as behavior analysis, education, and pharmacology, scrambling to meet the needs of a person transitioning from childhood to adolescence, adolescence to adulthood, and adulthood to aging. What we also see is a community often unprepared for the influx of persons with ASD joining and successfully participating after their primary education years.

In planning practice, we have learned many professionals, most parents, and almost all of the individuals with high-functioning autism and Aspergers Syndrome we serve are not familiar with the changes that are coming, the decrease in and sometimes non-existent supports, and the need for early, comprehensive planning in response to this unsteady future.

In this webcast, we will focus on identifying how and when to prepare a transition plan for an individual with an autism spectrum disorder. We will familiarize ourselves with the laws and regulations around providing supports for adolescents and adults with autism and other disabilities and/or mental illness during the transition phase. Both Federal and State laws must be considered and currently provide a somewhat rough path for those living with and serving these populations. In addition, if services are available in your state, they follow different laws, systems, and/or departments that provide and monitor service provisions.This will total 120 minutes with a review of practice and methodology designed for parents, teachers, professionals, counselors, adult service providers, paraprofessionals, BCABA's and BCBA's working with person's with autism and/or supervising treatment, and other professionals working with children with autism and related disorders.Note:DISCLOSURE:

Social Skills: Cool Ideas for Cool Kids,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)Children living with autism require a variety of interventions-the least of which involves social skill training. As professionals, we must move these children away from sitting and discussing skills and into a practical application during fun and interesting activities.What: Whether in the private clinic or school, professionals have the ability to conduct social skills groups. Social skill deficits are a given in children with autism, unfortunately, wide-spread research on necessary components of a program are not available. In separate studies, Bellini, Krasny, and Williams-White have identified promising strategies. These strategies such as role-playing, behavioral monitoring/feedback, and learning in sequence/progression and more will be discussed in this session.Why: Professionals have the desire to conduct social skills groups but perhaps not the time to plan and implement effective activities. Having a jumping-off point of activities allows the participant's creative juices to start flowing.Results: Not only with the children in these groups be involved with interventions that show promise from a research base but they will enjoy the session more with will increase participation and motivation. The professional will be able to implement activities that address child-specific goals and collect accurate data.What’s Next: The purpose of this session is a practical application. The intent is that the participant will be able to implement the newly learned activities and create their own.

Outcomes:

As a result of attending this session, participants will be able to:1. Implement interactive activities during social skills groups.
2. Incorporate popular movies into the social skill curriculum.Develop long-term, multi-week activities with pre-teen and teen aged children.Each purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note:DISCLOSURE:

Transition Survival 103: Must-Have Social Skills for Adolescents and Adults - Part 1,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)Remember the first time you interviewed for a job? What did you wear? What did you say when greeting people? How early did you arrive, 10, 15, or even 30 minutes early? How did you know what to say versus what not to say during the interview? Were you nervous, scared, or even confident?This is just one example of hundreds of social situations we learn about or are expected to somehow intuitively understand how to handle as we enter into adulthood. For persons with autism, we know the intuitive ability to understand is not truly intuitive. A person with autism and Asperger syndrome ""will require learning the unwritten rules of social culture, basically by rote. One by one, she must add each to a database of information so she can try to say and do the appropriate things at the appropriate times"" (Hawkins 2004, p. 69). Preparing for social situations we attempt during adulthood, such as an interview, requires exactly that - preparation.

When analyzing the above scenario further, we identify there are several cognitive processes required such as planning, understanding the consequences of your actions, discriminating what is acceptable in that specific situation versus what is not, and more. We will both identify these necessary skills and look at strategies to incorporate in teaching both early on in treatment years before the transition, as well as in the moment as one is preparing for a specific social experience, as social performance during a job interview is only one area of consideration.Outcomes:

Social Skills Part 2: Elementary Social Skills Predictors of Future Success,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)According to the , Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) now affects 1 in 59children. As this number continues to grow, so does the concern regarding the impact ASD has on social functioning. Between the ages of 5 and 12, a child must learn crucial skills in order to appropriately interact with their environment. While these skills may not be specifically taught, they continue to develop and change with every interaction in the individual’s environment including those with family, peers, teachers, etc.

At this developmental level, a child’s social skills are evolving and increasing to prepare them for independence. The social skills that the child acquires at this age will impact adolescence and adulthood. Children with autism experience significant challenges in the acquisition and growth of social skills. Among some of the challenges experienced include deficits in executive skills, social cues, and social rules.

Specific deficits include:
• Impulse control
• Organization
• Time-management
• Theory of mind
• Self-monitoring
• Body language
• Courtesy
• Remembering and attending to detail
• Many other basic social skills

Research has focused on a variety of teaching methods in order to increase developmental skills in children who have social skills deficits. A variety of evidenced-based behavior modification practices have increased appropriate social skills in elementary-aged children. While some practices have successfully increased social skills in this population, other interventions require additional evidence to prove the effectiveness of treatment.

This recorded event will total 120 minutes with a review of practice and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCaBAs and BCBAs working with persons with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with children with autism and related disorders.

Mand Training Across Modalities: Effective Methods to Teach Functional Communication,"
APA: 1.5General(Home Study)This 120-minute recorded webcast will review the literature on assessing and determining appropriate communication modalities, provide a task analysis for each type of communication modality, highlight video examples of communicating across modalities and discuss the pros and cons across various communication modalities.

Many individuals with limited functional communication lack the important skill of manding. Being able to request for one's own desires and needs is a powerful skill, and without this skill, quality of life may be detrimental. Being able to vocally mand is highly desirable, however, it is not the only way to communicate. American Sign Language, modified sign language, picture exchange systems, and augmentative communication are all various forms of communication. While mand training is similar across modalities, there are unique needs when developing a mand training intervention program for each communication modality.Outcomes:

Upon completion of Mand Training across Modalities: Effective Methods to Teach Functional Communication, participants will be able to:This event will total 100 minutes with a review of developing intervention programs to increase functional communication designed for teachers, BCABA's and BCBA's, and other professionals working with individuals with autism and related disorders.Each purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note: DISCLOSURE:

Social Skills Part 1: Toddler to Preschool Social Skills,"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)This  webcast will total 120 minutes with a review of theory and practice designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABA’s and BCBA’s working with person’s with autism and other behavior disorders, and other professionals working with adolescents and/or adults with autism, Asperger’s and related disorders.Though social skill deficit is recognized as a core characteristic of autism spectrum diagnosis, in practice many treatment programs and school classrooms struggle to find ways to accomplish success in this area. In some cases, social skills are not adequately addressed in the early years due to a perception these skills are too advanced to focus on at such a young age, or not appropriate with children that also have verbal and cognitive deficits.

Yet evidence shows children who lack social and emotional competence experience a delay in the acquisition of fundamental academic skills (Barbarin et al., 2006).In reality, when working with young children with ASD social skills may be a more difficult area for teaching due to many factors including deficits in verbal ability, cognitive ability, executive function, and theory of mind.

We will explore social skill areas that have been studied and determined important for active intervention due to their relation to successful outcomes such as:During the discussion, we will review intervention strategies used to increase social competence, eight primary behavior categories targeted by the social intervention, and identify ways to begin social competence training with children in the beginning stages of treatment and communication ability.

We will close with a discussion around the complexities of the theory of mind and executive functions, specific literature findings that debate its explanatory theory related to the autism disorder, specific tasks that are shown to improve executive function skills in preschoolers, and finally, how early deficits in executive function predicted later problem behaviors for students across multiple disruptive behavior disorders. 

Outcomes:Upon completion of Toddler to Preschool Social Skills: Predictors of future success participants will:1. Identify important social skills to assess for and treat with this age group
2. Understand strategies and specific tasks that may be implemented to increase social competence
3. Increase understanding of executive function definition and tasks related to building executive function skillsEach purchase corresponds to 1 user license/access.Note: DISCLOSURE:

Whether you're early in the SPD or Autism journey or have been grappling with this for many years, you may have felt hopeless and guilty about being unable to help your child. However, as a parent, you are inthebestposition to help your child become better, but you need the right tools to get there.We've created ourSPD Parent Kickstart Program to help you begin the progress through your SPD Journey. Our comprehensive program includes materials and actionable tools to help you address the most common problem areas that you encounter daily.

Ethics Code in Action: Behavior Analysts Behaving Badly: What to do When Your Colleague Misbehaves? (Recorded),"
CEU: 2 BACB Ethics or Type IIWhat does it mean to “behave badly?” In many cases, it may be easy to identify ethics code violations, but in some cases, it’s not so clear cut. What do you do when you see your colleagues engaging in bad behavior? Most BCBAs feel uncomfortable being in the role of a “whistleblower.” Yet, not taking action can have wide-sweeping negative consequences for clients, peers and the field of behavior analysis -- think Medicaid fraud!This session is designed to help BCBAs identify and categorize Ethics Violations to determine the most appropriate course of action. We will utilize the Bailey Triage Model, a decision-making framework for behavior analysts, first introduced in 2016 in our Ethics in Practice Series, to use as a guide. During this webinar, we will continue to explore and expand beyond its original use by analyzing additional scenarios submitted by BCBAs around the world. We will demonstrate how to use the Triage Model as a tool to systematically breakdown complex issues and to identify code violations to determine how to ethically discharge the responsibility of a BCBA while staying in compliance with the Ethics Code.Learning Outcomes:Webinar DetailsPresenter: Dr. Jon Bailey, PhD., BCBA-D

His lifelong mission is to disseminate quality ABA, which he defines as the knowledge and skills necessary to adapt ABA programs contextually - i.e. making those adjustments to account for different settings, situations andcircumstances, working in collaboration with a broad array of people with the singular goal --- helping students to acquire those skills necessary to achieve their highest level of independence.This Q&A session focused on answering questions related to concepts and practices discussed around Challenging Behaviors in Schools. The panelist answered questions generated by the participants either prior to the session or during the session. The goal wasto be interactive and move from the general concepts discussed in prior sessions to concrete actions in a specific context in which participants are working.

Deep Dive: Assessing Problem Behaviors in Schools and Developing a BIP Implementation Team and Review of Data (Recorded),"While developing Module 3, Dr. Detrich andour development team determined that this topic required far more attention than the original 2 hours allotted. In keeping with Special Learning's mission to provide the highest quality, timely, relevant, andactionableprofessional development opportunities, we determined that the best course of action would be to devote an additional 2-hours to give us an opportunity to take a much deeper dive into this complex topic.There are countless challengesinvolved in developing quality FBAs that can realistically be implemented given vastly different constraints inherent in school settings. In this session, Dr. Detrich leveraged his deep knowledge, expertise, and history of successprovided BCBAs with a blueprint for BIP implementation. He shared his framework, models, materials, and other tools that he and his team have developed and used successfully over the years to achieve positive outcomes - in spite of environmental constraints.In the previous session, Special Learning, Inc, and Dr. Ronnie Detrich presented the considerations andimplications of selecting FBA strategies that are most appropriate in a variety of settings, situations, and circumstances."," May 27, 2020",,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-596,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/596/image_15895639196385.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II

Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools Module 1: How to Maximize the Value and Facilitate Collaboration Across Service Providers (Recorded),"Often times, Behavior Analysts find themselves providing services in the school setting whether it is as a District Level Behavior Analyst, Behavior Specialist or a consultant. A common thread that is documented and has shown minimal progress for students is the confounding environmental variables that are found in the school setting. Such variables include the school structure and culture, motivation, and lack of resources. Due to these constraints, BCBAs find it difficult to maneuver to ethically address challenging behaviors in school settings. Without a fullunderstanding of the parameters and context of the school and its systems, the positive behavioral change will be limited and ultimately the student receiving services will not reach his/her highest level of independence.Special Learning, Inc with the renowned expert of Problem Behaviors in School Settings, targeted this topic uncoverring the key successes to facilitate collaboration in the school setting and in turn start the process to effectively address problem behaviors presented by students we serve.","Wednesday, March 11th, 2020",,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-575,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/575/image_15813619869922.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II
Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools Module 2: Must-have Skills (and Understanding) for School-based BCBAs and Other Service Providers (Recorded),"The “coin of the realm” for schools is academic achievement. How can an ABA provider provide his/her services for challenging behaviors if the program does not “fit” in the academic achievement definition identified by school districts? What happens when academic achievement is defined differently for the General Education (Gen Ed) sector in comparison to the Special Education (SPED) sector and the culture of each of these sectors are vastly different? Behavior Analysts find themselves in a conundrum in providing services in the school setting with all of these different variables.On Wednesday, April 8th, 2020, Special Learning, Inc with Problem Behaviors in School Settings subject matter expert, Dr. Ronnie Detrich and Shawn E. Kenyon, BCBA-D, dove in and discussed the unique cultural features of public schools in both Gen Ed and SPED sectors to uncover the key constraints in providing ABA services to students requiring an FBA and behavioral interventions so the school can meet the individualized needs of the student to remain in the school system (including IDEA).","Wednesday, April 8th, 2020",,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-576,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/576/image_15813620580331.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II

Organizational Ethics & OBM Webinar Series-Module 5: Best Practices in Organizational Ethics (RECORDED),"
(APA)2 General(Home Study)Every day, decisions are made by organizations that impact the lives of people around the world. In the field of healthcare, some decisions have profound consequences. Organizations with strong ethical underpinnings, staffed with professionals who place equal importance on ethics, make decisions that place the well-being and care of its recipients above all else. Other organizations that pay little attention to ethics may make decisions that have the potential to profoundly and negatively impact the lives of those individuals under their care.Most organizations fall somewhere in between.Ethical conduct of both professionals who provide behavior analytic services and those organizations that employ them are critically important in the field of behavior analysis. Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) are governed by the BACB's Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts. Unfortunately, organizations that employ BCBAs are not held to the same standard. In actuality, as yet, ABA agencies are not held to any ethical standards.During the 5 years we’ve been conducting live ethics webinars with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D, the world-renowned expert on ethics in the field of behavior analysis, we have seen the evolution of the field and the resulting consequences of this evolution as it pertains to ethics. It has become clearly evident that the ethical dilemmas in which many BCBAs and RBTs find themselves are the result of decisions that are made by the organizations that employ them. How do you address this?In our Organizational Ethics Series, we will explore this topic using a systems approach. The global autism ecosystem is comprised of many different parties, some of whom with conflicting agendas. And yet, in order to provide children, adolescents, and adults with the services they medically need, each member of the ecosystem must work together and do their part to fulfill their obligations. It is when members of this ecosystem fail to ethically discharge their obligations that things being to change -- for the worse.Last June 26, 2019, Special Learning hosted our 5th and final installment in theOrganizational (OBM) Ethics Series with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D. We reviewed key components of Organizational Ethics and delved head-on into the best and ethical practices for organizations.As with all our other Ethics webinars, we incorporated cases submitted by BCBAs and RBTs in the field to provide a deeper learning experience.WEBINAR DETAILS:Date:Wednesday, June 26, 2019

BIG MONEY IN ABA SERIES: Review of the Data (RECORDED) - 1 Hour,"2010 marks a new era in the field of behavior analysis and those ABA Service Provider organizations. In January 2010, Great Point Partners, a Private Equity (PE) firm with $370 million under management was the first PE firm to enter the Autism industry. . .With its acquisition of Pacific Child and Family Services, they created a platform company, Autism Learning Partners (ALP). Over the course of 8 years during which Great Point Partners (GPP) remained the BIG Money sponsor, ALP made 6 add-on acquisitions to become one of the largest ABA provider organizations in the U.S.In December 2016, Great Point Partners sold Autism Learning Partners to a larger PE firm, FFL Partners, with $1.5 BILLION under management. With this transaction, GPP exited the Autism industry with $270 million, realizing a return on investment which would end up being one of the most successful exits in the Autism industry.Since 2010, more than 60 PE firms have entered and left the field, buying and selling nearly 150 ABA service provider organizations. With targeted acquisitions of the largest ABA agencies and subsequent follow-on acquisitions, it would not be inaccurate to estimate the combined market share of PE-backed organizations as high as 70% to 80%.What does this mean? Who’s buying? Who’s selling? Who’s winning? Who’s losing?In this webinar, we addressed these questions andrevieweddata gathered over 6 months, with thousands of hours of investment to begin to piece together the real story.WEBINAR DETAILS:Date:March 25th, 2020Time:Noon to 1:00 pm CENTRALPanelist(s):Price:",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-572,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/572/image_15804942928419.png,$99.00,,Podcast,
LITE- Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessment & Monitoring Tool,"THIS IS OUR LITE VERSION of theSupervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessment & Monitoring ToolThis is adownloadable tooland does not include Continuing Education Credits.The field of behavior analysis has been undergoing a period of tremendous change. Some of these changes have the potential to transform the field into one of global recognition and standing; whereas other changes can delegitimize all the hard work, dedication and efforts to which the founders of the field and parents of children with autism or related disorders have dedicated their entire lives -- paving the path for the next generation of providers and recipients of ABA intervention.At Special Learning, we have always believed the single greatest factor in ensuring and maintaining quality in the field of behavior analysis is quality supervision!With great supervision, the profession can continue to add Minimal Viable Clinicians™ (MVCs™) who are qualified, competent BCBAs to the field, who in turn, will continue to develop equally qualified, competent BCBAs. Conversely, those pursuing credentialing who received less than quality supervision would then themselves become supervisors and perpetuate the downward spiral in quality service provisions.We believe that understanding the science of behavior has the potential to maximize the benefits of teaching in all situations, including the supervised fieldwork experience. The Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessmentand Monitoring Tool was created to assist supervisors and supervisees in the development and implementation of supervised fieldwork that is truly behavior analytic. As such, the supervised fieldwork experience and its oversight must adhere to the description proposed by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in their 1968 article “Some Current Dimensions of Applied Behavior Analysis”.This tool was designed for supervisors to guide supervisees in meeting mastery criteria to become an effective, ethical and competent Behavior Analyst, as is similar to other curriculum-based assessment tools. This project was in development for 4 years with input from many BCBAs® across the world.By using this system, you will be able to track specific behavior analytic skillsets of your supervisee. These have been identified by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board ® as necessary for behavior analysts, making them applied. The skills are clearly defined in terms that are observable and measurable for supervisors making it possible for this behavior change program to be both behavioral and analytic. This assessment includes supplementary materials for use in supervision activities to promote practice in the necessary skill sets, adding technological elements as well. By incorporating these principles into the supervision process, it is ensured that the supervision experience is conceptually systematic and that supervision is effective and promotes generalization of the skills necessary in the practice of behavior analysis.The Supervision Milestone Task Analysis Assessment & Monitoring Tool task analyzes (sub-domain) the BACB® Fourth Edition Task List (Task List) and Professional & Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts ® (PECC) by each Task List Item and creates an automated scoring across each sub-domain. In doing so, the Supervisor can analyze the progress of each of their supervisees with ease. This tool serves 5 functions:Facilitates the initial assessment of Supervisee on current skills and level of mastery across Task List items and sub-domains
Allows ongoing assessment and monitoring of skill deficits
Calculates scoring automatically to assist the Supervisor to focus on individualized skill development
Provides suggested homework and practical examples for a Supervisee to complete
Secures and stores completed detailed records of each Supervisee in one-place (i.e. restricted vs unrestricted and assessment method used as outlined by the Task List)There is a single tenet that ALL BCBA supervisors should live by…YOU are the key to the future of the field of behavior analysis",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-571,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/571/image_15786830521814.png,FREE,,Podcast,
Big Money in ABA Series- Module 1: Who’s Buying? Who’s Selling? Who’s Winning? Who’s Losing? (RECORDED),"To date, the field of ABA has seen nearly $2 BILLION dollars of capital investment in mergers and acquisitions (M&A)... activity from Private Equity (PE) firms. The 55 or so PE firms currently in the field of ABA manage over $1.5 TRILLION dollars of investment money -- controlling hundreds of BILLIONS of “dry powder” which has yet to be spent. There are many more NEW PE firms (not yet in our field) very aggressively seeking to add Autism businesses to their investment portfolio. As of today…There arenearly 90 MEGA ABA agencies (1,00 to 5,000 employees) in operation todayOf the 23 for-profit MEGA agencies, over 50% are owned or backed by PE firmsWe can talk data all day long, but the real question is... what does this mean for independent (for-private) ABA agencies? BCBAs and RBTs? Clients, who receive ABA services? For the profession of ABA? For the ABA “industry?”After the dust has settled, the hyper mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity has subsided and BIG Money has left the field, what will remain?

Business: Exit Strategies for ABA and Related Health Organizations (RECORDED),"When we started exploring the topic of the impact of private equity (PE) firms in the field of behavior analysis, we neglected to address a critical element -- exit strategies. I have rarely met an owner of an ABA organization who started their business expecting to sell it for tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars.The influx of billions of dollars from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, led by PE firms has created a market in which this is the reality -- not for all organizations, but enough to impact the field of behavior analysis in profound ways. Good or bad remains to be seen.But for 80% of agencies that escape the interest of PE firms -- typically because it's too small -- the answer to the question ""how can I (ethically) exit my business"" might not be clear.As an entrepreneur who actually did start a business with an exit strategy in mind, this has been top of mind for a long time.",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-549,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/549/image_15644990924772.png,$199.00,,Podcast,

ADHD Assessment and Diagnosis Across Settings Redone (RECORDED),"LEARN MOREAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 11% of American children have an Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) / Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. While an estimated 30% and 50% of people with Autism are also diagnosed with ADHD, this is a condition that affects the lives of children, adolescents, andadults, with or without developmental disabilities -- located in all walks of life.ADD and ADHD is a condition that can be effectively managed with the use of proper strategies. Evidence has shown that by using a proper combination of medication management and behavioral strategies, persons with ADD/ADHD can be given an opportunity to achieve their highest level of functioning. But what constitutes “proper combination?” How do you monitor this? Does this change over time? Like any other condition, early detection and intervention are key to future success.

Según los estudios, la respuesta activa del estudiante puede aumentar el éxito del estudiante y puede permitir que los estudiantes se involucren más en su propio aprendizaje como un participante activo.La idea detrás de la respuesta activa del estudiante es que los estudiantes se vuelven responsables de su propio aprendizaje al participar en actividades en todos los niveles y todos los estudiantes son un participante igual en las actividades de aprendizaje, en lugar de sólo el estudiante que se llama o levanta su mano. Esta técnica ha demostrado ser exitosa tanto en estudiantes con discapacidades como en estudiantes típicos (Lerner, 2011). Hay muchos beneficios a la respuesta activa del estudiante incluyendo:La respuesta activa del estudiante ha sido probada en diferentes grados, incluyendo la universidad y en programas de capacitación, con buenos resultados Colbert, 2005).

ESOP: Are You a Candidate for an ESOP Exit? (Recorded),"An Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) is a highly attractive exit vehicle for BCBA founders of Independent ABA Organizations. To many, an ESOP may appear “too good to be true.” Fundamentally, because the ESOP is overseen by an ESOP trustee who has a fiduciary responsibility to manage the ESOP, all decisions that are made by the organization serves the best interests of the company --- and it’s shareholders, the employees.And why not? Owners who sell to an ESOP can (1) transfer ownership of their business to those employees who were instrumental in the growth; (2) rest comfortably knowing that clients will continue to receive quality services; (3) sell 100% ownership of their business at a fair valuation; (4) walk away from the transaction with no holds or restrictions on sale proceeds; (5) protect their proceeds from taxes (proceeds can be tax-deferred); (6) continue to work for the business as a fairly compensated employee (for 12 months) or consultant (after 12 months) in whatever role of their choosing if it aligns with the needs of the business",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-581,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/581/image_15825664667697.png,$79.00,,Podcast,
Estrategias para Incrementar las Habilidades de Participación en el Aula,"Nivel: AvanzadoEste seminario de 120 minutos identificará los comportamientos iniciales que todos los niños deben poseer para tener éxito en un ambiente grupal y estrategias específicas para ayudar a lograr estas habilidades para los niños con autismo y otras necesidades especiales.
Sobre la base de la revisión de la literatura y la práctica exitosa en el mundo real, veremos las posibles funciones detrás de comportamientos problemáticos comunes tales como transiciones fuera de la tarea, fuera de asiento, interrupción y difíciles, así como estrategias rápidas y fáciles de implementar para cambiar el comportamiento . Incorporar procedimientos básicos de ABA, analizar el ambiente para posibles modificaciones, enseñar comportamientos de reemplazo e incorporar estrategias visuales son sólo algunas de las opciones que consideraremos.Muchos maestros y profesionales ya están conscientes de que investigaciones indican una intervención temprana intensa durante al menos 2 años durante los resultados preescolares para mejorar los resultados de las personas con autismo y trastornos relacionados (NIMH, pág. Como parte del modelo de Intervención Conductual Intensiva (IBI), los procedimientos de análisis de comportamiento básico como el refuerzo se aplican para aumentar la interacción social exitosa y las habilidades de comunicación.

En el mundo del análisis del comportamiento, esto ha ganado mucha atención y discusión externa durante los años en que, como todos aprendemos desde el principio en ABA, una intervención digna debería, entre otras cosas, ser una que posea validez social y la capacidad de Transferir su tecnología. Simplemente hablando, la transferencia de tecnología es la habilidad para que otra persona tome un método dado y lo duplique.Curiosamente, los estudios también han demostrado que es posible implementar con éxito estrategias de cambio de comportamiento dentro de las aulas de nuestro mundo real utilizando los componentes clave de IBI (Grindle, et.al) tales como refuerzo positivo, análisis de tareas, ensayos discretos, generalización, evaluaciones del comportamiento funcional , y más.Además, la literatura apoya el uso de estrategias visuales, apoyos ambientales, y el entrenamiento de pares (Garrison-Harrell, Kamps y Kravits, 1997).

Organizational Ethics & OBM Webinar Series-Module 4: Audit Proofing Your Organization (RECORDED),"
(APA)2 General(Home Study)For most ABA Organizations, selling to a PE firm is not an option as the minimum revenue requirement is $10 million and above. Does this mean that organizations with sales below $10 million can’t realize a financial exit? NO! There are several viable exit options for smaller, private agencies.An ability to exit a business for several millions of dollars just doesn’t just happen. It takes work and diligence to make a business attractive to an acquirer. In short, an organization has to show that it’s running a tight ship. Acquirers are looking to mitigate their risk. One way to demonstrate an organization’s ability to mitigate its greatest risk is to demonstrate its ability to successfully emerge from an insurance audit.AUDIT RISK - risks of insurance risk are high! Regardless of intent, If unsuccessful, penalties can range from clawbacks to criminal prosecution. If you receive funding from private insurance, chances are high that you WILL BE AUDITED! After all, an audit is an extremely effective tool insurance companies can use to reduce their total expenditures and increase client outcomes.Special Learning hostedour 4th installment in theOrganizational (OBM) Ethics Series with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D.

SLPs and BCBAs: How Do We Make Collaboration Work?,"This training is eligible for 2 BACB Type II CEUs.When the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is given, two core characteristics may immediately come to mind–communication and behavior. Delayed communication and challenging behaviors are fundamental concerns in individuals with autism. The cycle of poor language and challenging behavior is continuous and requires the collaboration of two very specific professionals to address these needs as well as the global needs of the individual and their family.

Over time, research has consistently shown that autism is a global and pervasive developmental disorder. Collaboration among professionals, effectiveness of communication and behavioral interventions are essential to achieve the best outcomes for those with ASD (Lloyd et al, 2012). As speaker Sharon Watts, MS, CCC-SLP, Speech-Language Pathologist stated, “When the fields of Speech-Language Pathology and Behaviorism collaborate, treatment can be maximized exponentially for individuals on the Autism spectrum and beyond.”

Partnerships between speech pathologists and behavior analysts increase the benefits for consumers of our services in treating speech, language, and swallowing disorders. In addition, these partnerships enhance communication between our related professions through conference presentations, collaborative research, workshops, publication of treatment protocols and materials, and many other venues. (http://behavioralspeech.com/)

So much of challenging behavior can be traced to poor communication skills and many communication deficits can likewise be drawn from challenging behavior. Because of this the line between the two fields often becomes blurred. However, both BCBAs and SLPs must adhere to their respective discipline’s code of ethics and only intervene within their own scope of practice. By knowing each discipline’s rich history, scope of practice, and philosophies, professional collaboration can be successfully accomplished.

This  webcast totals 120 minutes with a review of theory, philosophy, methodology, and practice for BCBAs, BCABAs, SLPs, administrators, and others working with these professionals and individuals with autism spectrum disorders.

Treating Food Refusal & Selectivity in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"This training is eligible for 2 BACB Type II CEUs.This 120-minute webcast provides an overview of the use of applied behavior analytic principles to assess and treat food refusal and selectivity. Feeding problems are common in children, affecting those with developmental disabilities and medical conditions as well as children who are typically developing (Laud, et al., 2009). Recent figures suggest prevalence of feeding problems in children with ASD are as high as 90% (Volkert & Vaz, 2010). A child with feeding problems can cause stressors to his or her own health and ability to learn in addition to causing stress on the family (making multiple meals, throwing away food, etc.) and impacting social opportunities (people socialize over meals).Feeding problems in children with ASD is treatable. The same as any challenging behavior, the behavior must first be assessed to determine the maintaining variables and determine potential reinforcers to increase food consumption. This presentation will provide examples of common indirect assessment tools with guidance on how to use the information. Following, we will provide you with examples of descriptive assessments along the use of the functional analysis to ensure the results are experimentally determined. Following results of the assessment, we will provide commonly used evidence-based procedures, antecedent and consequent-based, to increase food consumption. In addition, we will provide an overview of the legal and ethical considerations around treatment of feeding problems.This event will total 120 minutes with a review of practice and methodology designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, BCABA’s and BCBA’s working with person’s with autism and/or supervising direct treatment staff, and other professionals working with children with autism and related disorders.Outcomes:
Upon completion of Treating Food Refusal & Selectivity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Review, participants will:1. Identify commonly used assessments for treating food refusal and selectivity.
2. Identify commonly used evidence-based behavior analytic procedures for treating food refusal and selectivity.

Organizational Ethics & OBM Webinar Series-Module 2: Best Practices in Performance Management with Jon Bailey and Aubrey Daniels (RECORDED),"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)If you'vebeen in the field of behavior analysis for any length of time, it's more than likely that you'reaware of the significant business issues that have been plaguing the field. Major issues such as MASSIVE billing fraud (that we know of) and unethical decision-making leading to poor client outcomes and challenging work environments for ethical BCBAs, RBTs, and others who care about ethics.During the 2nd module in our , we lookat how Performance Management can be used as a tool to means to control unethical business practices. Within the past 7 to 10 years, the field of behavior analysis has become a big business for private equity (PE) firms. With each successful financial exit, the temptation to ""drive for profit"" increases exponentially to take advantage of the short window of opportunity during which field is able to provide higher than average sale multiples - typically 5 to 7 times earnings.With properly structured performance management systems, using a behavioral approach, we (Dr. Bailey, Aubrey Daniels, and Karen Chung) believe that we can begin to develop a framework which will allow organizations, PE backed or otherwise, to achieve dual objectives of exceptional health outcomes and higher than average bottom line profits.-----------Incentive compensation is a highly effective means of attaining organizational objectives. By using success metrics that are tied to successfully meeting organizational objectives, businesses can influence the behavior of individuals and groups to achieve desired outcomes. Incentive compensation is a very effective tool to drive desired behavior in any business. But how does this work in healthcare?When applied to the field of healthcare, more specifically, the field of behavior analysis, organizational goals are often multi-faceted. In most businesses, top line and bottom-line growth is used to measure year over year success. But equally (or more) important is customer outcomes. Attaining profit (or other financial) objectives without meeting quality standards can be seen as an ethical violation of an organization's responsibility to its customers, employees, and the field of behavior analysis.With proper structure, alignment of interests, and internal processes, organizations can achieve both quality customer outcomes and organizational profits. But this requires deliberate action.On Wednesday, February 20, 2019, Special Learning hosted our 2nd installment in theOrganizational (OBM) Ethics Series with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D. We presented and discussed a performance management model for ABA organizations designed to balance customer outcomes with profit objectives. As with all our other Ethics webinars, we incorporated cases submitted by BCBAs and RBTs in the field to provide a deeper learning experience.WEBINAR DETAILSOriginal Date of Broadcast:Wednesday, February 20, 2019

Intro to ESOP: an Alternative Exit Strategy (RECORDED),"As Private Equity is nearing a saturation point, the field of ABA is yet again facing fundamental changes.Over the past 10 years, there have been over 100 ABA Provider Organizations that have been acquired by PE or PE-backed platform companies. While the M&A activity is still at a frenzied pace, the valuations and terms of the deals have changed significantly to reflect changes in the power structure. As such, valuations have come down to somewhat rational multiples of earning from double digits to a reasonable single digit. However, as reflected by the higher than typical PE multiples in other sectors of mid-single digits, interest in acquiring ABA Provider Organizations is still high.However, significant changes are taking place as the power structure shifts in favor of PE firms.As the hyper M&A activity is coming to a close, valuations continue to fall and the terms of the deal are structured such that the seller becomes an employee with the mandatory 2-year stay. Even more puzzling, some terms now include a portion of the sale price to be set aside in escrow with certain triggers to release the funds. As these triggers are typically tied to hitting predetermined revenue and profit increases, the role of the seller changes from being an owner to an employee - albeit with an incredibly compelling contingency - millions of dollars.Most clinicians have very little background in business. In the field of ABA, nearly all BCBAs pursued their BCBAs because they saw the power of ABA and became passionate about applying this technology to help change lives. Over a period of time, as BCBA-led small agencies continued to grow, owners of ABA organizations unwittingly and unwillingly became entrepreneurs.Regardless of the original intent of the business, it’s understandable that as BCBAs owners saw their colleagues become multi-millionaires, they also began to explore the same options. Unfortunately, the impact and influence of private equity in the field of ABA have caused irreparable damage to the field of behavior analysis, the science of behavior analysis, BCBAs and RBTs who provide ABA services, and ultimately clients. Through Dr. Jon Bailey’s Ethics Hotline and his response to the thousands of emails he has been receiving BCBAs and RBTs, we are beginning to see a very gloomy picture emerge.BCBAs and RBTs report by the thousands, unethical acts committed by ABA organizations - small and large alike. These range from padding hours, delivering more hours than is required to maintain clients, exploiting RBTs with unethical and sometimes illegal business practices, and most shockingly, replacing clients with severe problem behaviors with those whose conditions are much less severe. Additionally, organizational policies of limiting the driving distance to clients’ homes is resulting in clients not receiving services.However, in spite of the troubling trends, there are many BCBAs who are looking to exit their business for various reasons. Some are ready to retire, some run into difficult personal situations; some are too far removed from their passion - providing client care - that their job is no longer gratifying. And there are others who are just simply tired. Regardless of the reasons and circumstances, there will always be a need for an exit strategy. More now than ever, the market has desperate need for BCBAs to ethically exit their business, one that allows them to feel comfortable that their employees will be treated well, that their clients will be cared for, and that the mission of the organization will be carried on by people who are equally or perhaps even more passionate about carrying out the mission of the organization. --- to provide the highest quality care to as many people as possible to make the world a better place.An Employee Stock Options Plan (ESOP) is an alternative exit strategy that allows BCBAs who are passionate about leaving behind a positive legacy to achieve their goals. With an ESOP, the owner has the option to take the funds and exit the business altogether, or stay on as an employee or a consultant, in whatever capacity that best serves the needs of the organization, for as long as they desire.To many, an ESOP may appear “too good to be true.” Fundamentally, because the ESOP is overseen by an ESOP trustee who has a fiduciary responsibility to manage the ESOP, all decisions that are made by the organization serves the best interests of the company --- and it’s shareholders, the employees.WEBINAR DETAILS:Date:February 19th, 2020Time:Noon to 1:00 pm CENTRALPanelist(s):",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-574,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/574/image_15810253595731.png,$79.00,,Podcast,

ABA Level 1 (Russian) Session 8: Strategies to Increase Classroom Participation SKills,"Based upon literature review and successful practice in the real world we will look at the possible functions behind common problem behaviors such as off-task, out of the seat, interrupting, and difficult transitions as well as quick and easy strategies one can implement to change behavior. Incorporating basic ABA procedures, analyzing the environment for possible modifications, teaching replacement behaviors, and incorporating visual strategies are just some of the options we will consider.
Many teachers and professionals are already aware evidence indicate intensive early intervention for at least 2 years during preschool results in improved outcomes for persons with autism and related disorders (NIMH, pg. 14). As part of the Intensive Behavioral Intervention (IBI) model, basic behavior analysis procedures like reinforcement are applied to increase successful social interaction and communication skills. However, studies that describe this level of intensity in well-controlled clinical environments can seem overwhelming, and many times cause frustration and perhaps be dismissed by that outside of the experimental world because it seems unfair and unlike the daily life we live where things may be unpredictable and ever-changing.In the world of behavior analysis this has gained much outward attention and discussion over the years where, as we all learn from the very beginning in ABA, a worthy intervention should, among other things, be one that possesses both social validity and the ability to transfer its technology. Simply speaking, transferring technology is the ability for someone else to take a given method and duplicate it.Excitingly, studies have also demonstrated it is possible to successfully implement behavior change strategies within our real-world classrooms using key components of IBI (Grindle, et.al) such as positive reinforcement, task analysis, discrete trial teaching, generalization, functional behavior assessments, and more. In addition, the literature supports the use of visual strategies, environmental supports, and peer training (Garrison-Harrell, Kamps and Kravits, 1997). These procedures can translate into the real-world classrooms and environments the majority of us spend our time.Our Webinar Series will look in detail at key components to incorporate in the classroom with the goal of helping you increase a child’s appropriate classroom behavior and time in the inclusive environment.

Based upon literature review and successful practice in the home, clinical and school settings, we will review how to initiate and conduct a functional behavior assessment including all key components (indirect assessments, descriptive assessments, and the functional analysis). Learners will not only gain information on the tools used to conduct the various assessments, but they will also become competent in implementation through demonstration and video coding. The audience will gain knowledge in identifying the reinforcing variables that maintain challenging behaviors and how to successfully implement neutral direction. This is the first part of a 2-part series.Our Webinar Series will look in detail at key components to incorporate in the classroom with the goal of helping you increase a child’s appropriate classroom behavior and time in the inclusive environment. While providing real-life examples of success and difficulties we will focus on strategies you can implement today as we study specific classroom behaviors from assessment to successful behavior change procedure implementation.This event incorporates practice and methodology, and is designed for BCBA’s and BCABA’s needing further training on direct FBA implementation, school behavior specialists, teachers, BCABA’s and BCBA’s working and consulting in schools, and other professionals working in a classroom environment with children with autism and related disorders.Outcomes:
Upon completion of Decreasing Problem Behavior with an FBA: Part 1 participants will:1. Identify the need for a behavior reduction plan and construct a behavioral definition.
2. Complete a functional behavioral assessment (indirect and direct assessment and functional analysis).

"ADD/ADHD Training Series: Q&A with Dr. Ronald T. Brown, PhD (RECORDED)","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11 percent of American children, ages 4 to 17, have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is an increase of 42 percent in just eight years. Studies show that between 30 and 50% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) manifest ADHD symptoms (particularly at preschool age). Similarly, research also estimates two-thirds of individuals with ADHD show features of ASD (Davis and Kollins, 2012).There are many similarities in symptoms between ADHD and ASD - difficulties in attention, communication, impulsivity, restlessness, or hyperactivity - which can often lead to a misdiagnosis. Additionally, both syndromes cause significant behavioral, academic, emotional, and adaptive problems in school, at home, and elsewhere. (Rao and Landa, 2013).Beyond the official medical diagnosis, educators, health providers and parents, all of whom interact with and provide intervention to individuals with ADHD often lack training on appropriate strategies that can be implemented during education, therapy, and play sessions to help individuals with ADD/ADHD.Research shows that a combination of medication and behavioral intervention often generates the best outcomes, yet educators, providers, and parents lack sufficient knowledge of either psychopharmacology and behavior interventions specific to helping individuals with ADD/ADHD.Last November 15, 2018, Special Learning hosted a Q&A session with Dr. Ronald T. Brown, Ph.D., a noted expert who serves as professor and dean for the Schools of Allied Health Sciences for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. During this 2 hour sessions, he provided answers to questions regarding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) - the history, prevalence, misconceptions, diagnosis, and intervention.WEBINAR DETAILSOriginal Date of Broadcast: Thursday, November 15, 2018

Successful collaboration requiredclearly defined roles and responsibilities, particularly in those areas in which there are overlaps in services.

Organizational Ethics & OBM Webinar Series-Module 3: Best Practices in Billing (RECORDED),"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)Every day, decisions are made by organizations that impact the lives of people around the world. In the field of healthcare, some decisions have profound consequences. Organizations with strong ethical underpinnings, staffed with professionals who place equal importance on ethics, make decisions that place the well-being and care of its recipients above all else. Other organizations that pay little attention to ethics may make decisions that have the potential to profoundly and negatively impact the lives of those individuals under their care.Most organizations fall somewhere in between.Ethical conduct of both professionals who provide behavior analytic services and those organizations that employ them are critically important in the field of behavior analysis. Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) are governed by the BACB's Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts. Unfortunately, organizations that employ BCBAs are not held to the same standard. In actuality, as yet, ABA agencies are not held to any ethical standards.During the 5 years we’ve been conducting live ethics webinars with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D, the world-renowned expert on ethics in the field of behavior analysis, we have seen the evolution of the field and the resulting consequences of this evolution as it pertains to ethics. It has become clearly evident that the ethical dilemmas in which many BCBAs and RBTs find themselves are the result of decisions that are made by the organizations that employ them. How do you address this?In our Organizational Ethics Series, weexploredthis topic using a systems approach. The global autism ecosystem is comprised of many different parties, some of whom with conflicting agendas. And yet, in order to provide children, adolescents, and adults with the services they medically need, each member of the ecosystem must work together and do their part to fulfill their obligations. It is when members of this ecosystem fail to ethically discharge their obligations that things being to change -- for the worse.Special Learning with hosted our 3rd installment in theOrganizational (OBM) Ethics Series with Dr. Jon Bailey, Ph.D., BCBA-D.

"Ethics of Medicaid Fraud: Scenarios and Q&A with Dr. Jon Bailey, BCBA-D","CEU: 2 BACB® Ethics or Type II(Included with purchase)CEU: 2 QABA® Ethics or General(Included with purchase)On August 22, 2018, with Dr. Jon Bailey, BCBA-D, and 3 exceptional panelists, we explored the topic of . In reviewing previous cases of Medicaid fraud, it was clear that for those agencies sanctioned by Medicaid in FL, and other behavioral agencies previously sanctioned - and even convicted - for healthcare fraud, ethics was either a non-consideration or just plain “thrown out the window.”But what we also learned during that session is that there are many, many agencies with a strong commitment to ethics, at both professional and organizational levels, looking for direction on how to put systems and controls in place to avoid situations such as billing fraud and other health care fraud and abuse from occurring at all.Although health care fraud and abuse is an uncomfortable topic for many health professionals, it is also a topic that deserves a lot of attention and exploration. By developing organizational systems to curtail unethical business practices and to foster a culture that embraces ethics - not as a punitive measure, but as a tool to help drive best practices – the field of behavior analysis can demonstrate our collective commitment to operating ethically.By creating a system of accountability throughout the field, behavioral agencies can become a trusted partner to those agencies providing the necessary funding that allows hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. with Autism and other special needs to get access to the services that they desperately need.The field of behavior analysis is young enough that we can reverse this dangerous trend and set ourselves apart from other professions without the same level of commitment to behaving ethically. Done properly, the field of behavior analysis can become an example of best practices in the field of healthcare.Join us as we continue our journey of exploring this critically important topic by analyzing cases and providing answers to questions submitted by BCBAs and behavioral services agencies across the U.S.WEBINAR DETAILSPresenter:

What are those immutable boundaries that exist in schools that can’t be crossed?On this webinar, Dr. Bailey, along with our panel of subject matter experts, identifiedethics-related issues that are considered so severe that violations may lead to disciplinary actions. Using case scenarios submitted by BCBAs working in schools, we identified and examined these types of violations.

On May 2018, due to egregious, and perhaps pervasive, Medicaid billing fraud perpetuated by some agencies providing ABA services, AHCA (Agency for HealthCare Administration), the organization responsible for overseeing the $25.2 billion Medicaid programs serving 4.27 million people living in FL., imposed a 6-month moratorium on adding new ABA service providers.Shortly thereafter, in July 2018, AHCA announced that it took action against 4 agencies that engaged in egregious billing fraud - DRA Behavior Health, MGM Behavioral, Harmony Mental Health and Behavioral Services and Meli Medical Center, Inc. Furthermore, AHCA also announced that they are conducting ongoing investigations, which will lead to further sanctions.So, what are the consequences?In reviewing ethics case scenarios submitted by practicing BCBAs® over the same period of time, it became very clear that in many instances, actions taken by organizations caused the ethical dilemmas. This situation is certainly a case in point.During our August 22, 2018 live webinar with Dr. Jon Bailey and our Subject Matter Experts, we explored the topic of Medicaid fraud and its implications, both short term and long term, to the field of behavior analysis, professionals, and agencies that are part of the service delivery system. We analyzed the actions and possible motivations of the 5 agencies cited above, repercussions to BCBAs® caught in the scandal, and possible reasons behind the breach of responsibility of BCBAs® who were aware of the billing fraud, but failed to report this to the BACB and/or Medicaid fraud hotline.Using the cases above as lessons learned, we discussed proactive measures that individual BCBAs® and RBTs® can put in place to avoid being entangled in these situations, and how to avoid working for, or being associated with, organizations committing unethical acts.Wealso discussed organization-wide systems and controls that agencies should have in place to become, and to be recognized, as an Ethical Organization in the field of health services.Lastly, we unveiled the launch of the Ethics Standards Board for ABA Providers (ESBAP.)Webinar DetailsPresenter:Dr. Jon Bailey, PhD., BCBA-D

ADHD Literature Review Webinar: Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Overview of the Evidence (RECORDED),"
APA: 1General(Home Study)Dr. Ronald T. Brown conducted a live, video-based Literature Review of . This paper was written in collaboration with other distinguished experts Robert W. Amler, MD; Wendy S. Freeman, Ph.D.; James M. Perrin, MD; Martin T. Stein, MD; Heidi M. Feldman, MD, Ph.D.; Karen Pierce, MD; Mark L. Wolraich, MD; and the Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.This paper is a review and synthesis of existing literature on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder for the ""purpose of developing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."" ""These reviews provided substantial information about different treatments for ADHD and their efficacy in improvingcertain characteristics or outcomes for children with ADHD.""This paper concludes ""...the evidence strongly supports the use of stimulant medications for treating the core symptoms of children with ADHD and, to a lesser degree, for improving functioning. Behavior therapy alone has only a limited effect on symptoms orfunctioning of children with ADHD, although combining behavior therapy with medication seems to improve functioning and may decrease the amount of (a stimulant) medication needed.""For cancellations and refunds, please see our policy",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-460,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/460/image_15934878142831.png,$39.00,1,Podcast,II

Multidisciplinary Collaboration Series- Module 1: IEP Team Multidisciplinary Collaboration (RECORDED),"
APA: 2 General(Home Study)LEARN MOREThe role of an IEP team is to ensure that students with special needs are provided with access to quality services they need to achieve the best student outcomes. While the objectives are typically clearly defined, success hinges on how well the IEP team members are able and willing to collaborate to achieve desired outcomes. Unfortunately, many IEP meetings end up being contentious and unproductive -- not because team memberdisagrees with desired outcomes, but because the group was not taught how to successfully collaborate as a team. Successful collaboration requires clearly defined roles and responsibilities, particularly in those areas in which there are overlaps in services. It also requires a solid understanding of each other’s educational and professional backgrounds to define realistic expectations. Additionally, it requires a strong understanding of relevant laws and regulations, including IDEA and the various professional and ethical guidelines that professionals are required to uphold.Learning Outcomes:WEBINAR DETAILSOriginal Date of Broadcast:Thursday, January 31, 2019 (Recorded)

"Ethics in Schools: Best Practices with Jon Bailey, PhD, BCBA-D (RECORDED)","BCBAs working in school systems face unique, often significant challenges as compared to their counterparts working in private sectors. As school systems operate under different sets of assumptions, standards and expectations, BCBAs often find themselves trapped in situations of conflict as they try to balance their responsibility for meeting student outcomes and expectations of the school system, while avoiding violation of the BACB ethics code.On June 27, 2018, during our Ethics in School Systems LIVE webinar with Dr. Jon Bailey, PhD., BCBA-D the world's foremost expert on the topic of Ethics in the field of behavior analysis, we examined challenges commonly faced by BCBAs working in school systems.

Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools Module 4: Using ABA Programming in Schools in a Collaborative Model to  Begin to Manage Problem Behaviors (Recorded),"The Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) is key in changing problem behaviors, however, getting buy-in and consistent implementation by school personnel has its own set of challenges. When Behavior Analysts incorporate and understand different cultural norms (i.e. race, religion, language, cultural etc.), the BIP can be developed to include these factors to facilitate success quickly and effectively. Along with incorporating cultural norms, the most successful problem behaviors managed in schools also take into consideration and incorporate meaningful and manageable data collection which truly “tells the story” of the progress of the student.In our 4th installment of the , Special Learning, Inc, and Dr. Ronnie Detrich, the Problem Behavior in School Settings Subject Matter Expertexplored the positive impact of creating and implementing a well thought out BIP has on managing problem behaviors in schools by incorporating critical elements that fit within the context of the school setting and behavioral science research.",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-578,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/578/image_15813622690297.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II

Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools Module 3: Assessing Problem Behaviors in Schools and Developing a BIP Implementation Team (RECORDED),"Completing a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) in schools has its challenges- especially for behaviors that are multiply controlled. In clinic settings, such cases would strongly warrant a formal FA; however, in the school setting, can this method be safely implemented or is it ethical to not perform an FA? This question plagues many behavior analysts who work with students who engage in severe problem behaviors in the school setting.Special Learning, Inc, and  Dr. Ronnie Detrich, the Problem Behavior in School Settings Expert hasundertakenthis conundrum and provided key successful elements and considerations when completing an FBA for students in the school setting. From there, continued to the process of developing a BIP andcreated a BIP that works within the school environment’s constraints so the BIP is implemented effectively and the student truly becomes successful.","Wednesday, May 13th, 2020",,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-577,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/577/image_15813621708661.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II
Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools Module 5: Maintaining Treatment Integrity and Thorough Data Analysis (Recorded),"One of the biggest challenges that behavior analysts in school must address is having classroom staff implement an intervention with sufficient integrity to make a positive difference in student outcomes. In this session, participants will learn the various dimensions of treatment integrity and a pragmatic approach to making decisions about continuing or changing interventions because of lack of effectiveness. Finally, once an intervention is in place, it is necessary to measure the impact the intervention has on the behavior of interest. The challenge for behavior analysts in schools is finding measures that are both sensitive to change and can be recorded by existing classroom staff. If both of the conditions cannot be met then other measurement options must be considered. Some of those options will be discussed in this module.This 2-hour webinar hosted on Wednesday, August 12th, 2020, weexplored common behavioral strategies and procedures and how to effectively implement such procedures to increase collaboration and carry-through within the school setting.During this recordedwebinar, case scenario(s) and examples were provided for the full illustration of topics discussed. Participants were encouraged to submit questions and received real-time answers from experts.WEBINAR DETAILS:Date:Wednesday, August 12, 2020Time:3:00pm to 5:00 pm CENTRALPresenter:Ronnie Detrich, PhDPrice:$79 (includes 30-day access to the recording of the LIVE event and CEUs)2 Learning (Type-II) BACB® CEUs",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-579,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/579/image_15953758417557.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II
Addressing Challenging Behaviors in Schools: Q&A with Dr. Ronnie Detrich (RECORDED),"As school-based BCBAs are very well aware, the ability to work effectively in schools is not a skill that most BCBAs possess naturally. Even those with a long history of working in schools learned through the school of hard knocks and have a lot of bruises to show for it. But even veterans can benefit from learning from those with even greater experience and knowledge.
Dr. Ronnie Detrich is one of the ""founders"" of the field of (Applied) Behavior Analysis. His scope of work spans over 50+ years, most of which has been in clinical practice. His lifelong mission is to disseminate quality ABA, which he defines as the knowledge and skills necessary to adapt ABA programs contextually - i.e. making those adjustments to account for different settings, situations, andcircumstances, working in collaboration with a broad array of people with the singular goal --- helping students to acquire those skills necessary to achieve their highest level of independence.

In working in environments as complex as school systems, hundreds of situations arise daily for which there are no clear-cut answers. In order to help school-based BCBAs navigate through those challenges, we hosted a special 2-hour Q&A webinar with Dr. Ronnie Detrich provided clarity and a roadmap on how to best address those challenges -- effectively and ethically.WEBINAR DETAILS:DATE: Wednesday, April 29th, 2020TIME: 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm CENTRALSUBJECT MATTER EXPERT: PRICE: $79 (includes 30-day access to the recording of the LIVE event and CEUs)2 Learning (Type-II) BACB® CEUs",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-590,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/590/image_15871567899402.png,$79.00,2,Podcast,II

RBT Readiness Webinar,"The field of ABA has experienced significant changes over the past few years. With insurance reform as the primary driver, the mandatory requirement to have RBT credentialed staff providing direct care services for government and insurance funding has fundamentally changed the field as we know it.

In less than 3 years, the number of RBTs has grown from 0 to over 32,000! Even with this exponential growth, the field still need over 150,000 RBTs just to meet current demand. Imagine what impactthis is having on the job market!

Addressing Challenging Behaviors Ethically in Schools (5-Part Series with 10 CEUs),"What’s the problem? The problem is quality!Schools have vastly different EOs, MOs, and AOs from their missions, objectives, success metrics and methods of delivering services that are completely different than those found in the private sector. Major challenges that face behavior analysts while providing services in the school-setting include (but not limited to): resistance and push back, lack of buy-in from administrators and other stakeholders, culture, objectives not aligned with successful student outcomes, and lack of resources.Even when behavior analysts are able to overcome those issues, there still remains the problem of competency. Most BCBAs are taught to apply ABA in center-based and home-based settings where availability of resources, including sufficient funding, supervisors and front-line staff are plentiful. However, in schools there are severe resource constraints being a common thread across districts, for most BCBAs, it’s nearly impossible to implement the same programs as those in more traditional settings.What’s our solution? Backfilling the knowledge gap.Managing severe problem behavior is one of the fundamental responsibilities of BCBAs, regardless of sitting. In schools, the consequences of failure are extremely high, both in terms of risk to schools and the lives of students.We have partnered with Dr. Ronnie Detrich, PhD, to systematically backfill this knowledge gap of school-based BCBAs. He has recently been involved in education reform in order to continue to advance evidence-based practices in education to “assure high levels of treatment integrity at scales of social importance and the dissemination and actual implementation of effective programs”.",,,Special-Learning,https://store.special-learning.com/products/product-580,https://sl-shopping-cart.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/products/580/image_15972425826928.png,$315.00,10,Podcast,II

Second to the topic of consent, the other area that is most problematic for school-based BCBAs and RBTs is the need to modify programming to take into consideration the culture and availability of resource in districts while maintaining treatment fidelity.Sections 2.09 and 4.0 of the BACB Ethics Code addresses clients' rights to receive effective, evidence-based treatments. As behavior analysts sometimes work in environments in which they have very little control, the need to modify programming is a regular part of their job, but how do you modify programming while maintaining treatment integrity?This webinar takes a deep look at Code Sections 2.09 and 4.0 of the BACB Ethics Code. As with other webinars in our , we will present relevant content, which will be used to set the stage for addressing real-time, relevant questions and analyzing scenarios those that BCBAs and RBTs face on a daily basis.Webinar DetailsPresenter:Dr. Jon Bailey, PhD., BCBA-D
