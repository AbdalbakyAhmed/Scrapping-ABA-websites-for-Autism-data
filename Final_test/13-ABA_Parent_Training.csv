Bilingual Families with a Child with ASD: A Research Review and Recommendations,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficits or differences in communication skills. Since speaking two or more languages in a household may seem like it could cause more challenges for children who struggle with communication and speech development, it is important to look at the research to consider best practice and learn about how to best help families who are bilingual.Additionally, being culturally competent as a clinician is essential to any type of human service including when providing applied behavior analysis.With this in mind, lets consider a research review titled “”The report from the review offers the following abstract:“Because social communication impairment is a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making the right decision regarding language use for bilingual families of children with ASD is pertinent. The present review evaluated eight studies identified as addressing bilingual language development in 182 children with ASD and issues/perceptions of bilingualism in 62 parents of children with ASD. Studies were summarized in terms of participants, languages spoken and communication level, assessment/intervention, instruments, main findings, and evidence of bilingual language development. Findings suggested bilingualism does not have a negative impact on language development for children with ASD, but the majority of parents reported that practitioners predominantly advised against providing a bilingual environment. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the adoption of bilingualism for families of children with ASD are discussed (Drysdale, van der Meer, & Kagohara, 2015).”Per the review, families may feel conflicted as to how best to help their child with autism when it comes to promoting communication skills. Parents may ask themselves whether they should speak one or both languages in the home.They may ask themselves whether they should promote just one or both languages when teaching their child to develop his or her communication skills.Parents may wonder whether to focus on the parent’s primary or preferred language or to focus on the language that the child is likely to be exposed to the most.The authors of the review note that speaking two or more languages is the norm for almost two-thirds of the world’s population! This is an amazing statistic and very encouraging when it comes to promoting bilingual communication and multicultural experiences.The researchers found that throughout the studies they reviewed, overall, bilingualism being present in the household does not have a negative impact on children with ASD specifically as it relates to communication skills.However, this finding should be taken with caution and any clinical or treatment recommendations must be made based upon the individual client.A culturally sensitive approach to treatment should be utilized when service providers guide parents to help their children develop communication skills.The researchers found that children with autism can make progress in their communication skills in both the primary language spoken in the home as well as in the secondary language spoken in the home or outside the home.This idea supports the concept of generalization in applied behavior analysis in that children are able to extend their skills to new behaviors and in new settings. It also relates to some ideas from relational frame theory in that children can make relations between language concepts to help them learn and expand their language development.It is important to thoroughly assess a client’s current level of functioning. An assessment would also include obtaining input from parents.When development treatment goals and recommendations, be sure to consider the parent’s input. You may also find it helpful to consider the input of teachers and other caregivers. Providing training to parents and other important people in the child’s life can be helpful for supporting the child’s skill development. Collaboration with these important individuals can really help promote positive outcomes.In summary, having two languages spoken in the home of a child with autism does not tend to negatively interfere with communication skill development. However, it is always important to consider the individual child when making clinical recommendations.It is important to collaborate with parents and other important individuals in the child’s life, such as teachers and other caregivers, when working on communication skills. This is particularly relevant for bilingual families to ensure consistency and support across settings and experiences.To support a family’s preference for speaking Spanish within the home and to provide culturally competent services to families who prefer to receive training in Spanish, you may consider the .You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Theories of human development: Ways of Looking at Human Behavior,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.It can be helpful to look at the families that you work with from a broader lens. Considering how people develop and change over time can help you to better understand where the parents you work with are coming from in terms of their developmental stage in life.There are a variety of theories that explore the way people behave. There are many factors that play a role in someone’s current functioning.How can we explain the behavior of our clients?We can look at human behavior from any of the following perspectives. When we take in the variety of perspectives possible for understanding human behavior, we can create a more helpful approach to working with families.When you are providing ABA parent training services, consider the systems at play. A system is something that is made of separate yet related parts. Within parent training, you are often working most directly with a family system. Consider how each family member plays a role in the behavior of other family members. One person’s positive reinforcement experience can be another person’s negative reinforcement experience or even punisher. The matching law may be present in some situations such as when a child is more reinforced by one parent than the other. There are many ways that behavior is impacted by the dynamics within a family system.Conflict is common in all parts of society. Conflict is present at an individual level, between two people. It is also present on a larger scale such as between small or large groups of people.In your ABA parent training services, you can see that conflict is present in that people most often are looking to access their own reinforcement. Sometimes this creates conflict between them and someone else.Try to assess the nature of the conflict and what each person is experiencing within that conflict and what resolution they would both ideally like to have in order to create an effective intervention.People often behave in ways that align with an effort to obtain something that achieves some sort of goal. A parent may want less noise in the home therefore they may behave in ways to decrease tantrums their child exhibits. A child may want more leisure time so they may behave in ways that are an attempt to access more leisure and demand-free time.While considering the goal-directed nature of human behavior, we can also explore how people tend to exchange resources, such as attention, time, information, and physical acts in order to obtain or give a certain outcome. People generally want to maximize their reinforcement and minimize punishment experiences. People engage in interactions to obtain or give reinforcement or punishment.When an individual, even a child, is not provided with enough reinforcement, they may experience a “power struggle” in which it seems that one party has more control over the other. Of course, parents are naturally designed to have some “control” over their children. However, it is still helpful to consider in what ways the parents are allowing some child-directed interactions and dynamics within the home.Being culturally competent is important in all human services including in ABA parent training. A person’s way of viewing things and then behaving on how they perceive their experiences is, in part, based on traditions, culture, and historical contexts of the society in which they live or that in which they identify as being a part of.Human behavior is influenced by development. Development is influenced by the way in which a person follows through a set of stages. These stages are often experienced in a certain order although there is some flexibility in that some people may not follow the expected stage order exactly.From a social behavioral perspective, people behave in ways that are based on what they have learned through social experiences. Primarily, people learn in the context of their interactions with the environment. They can learn through pairing multiple stimuli. They can learn through the process of reinforcement or punishment. And they can learn through imitation of stimuli, including other people, in their environment.Classical and operant conditioning is the primary method of changing human behavior when looking strictly through a social behavioral lens.Through a humanistic lens, people behave in ways that help them to align with meaningful goals. They are motivated to behave in ways that help them to live according to their true selves or their true values. Although, from this perspective, private events play a role in a person’s behavior, this can still connect with an applied behavior analysis approach because a person’s private events can motivate them to behave in particular ways. For instance, a person who experiences a private event related to having the value of family may be motivated to behave in a way that leads to spending more time with their family. This behavior can then be reinforced by the experience they have with their family and the additional private events that may occur such as a personal thought that says they enjoyed or are glad that they spent time with family.Consider how the above perspectives can help you to better understand the parents you are working with in your ABA parent training services. Although these perspectives may have been developed as individual approaches to understanding human behavior, they can be used in combination to help you better understand the experience of your clients.In summary, people are generally driven to obtain reinforcement. They want to live a meaningful life that is true to who they are. Their behavior is influenced by the interactions they have with other people and the rules and expectations placed upon them. Their behavior is guided by general developmental stages and then reinforced or punished by their interactions with the environment.As we learned from this article, a person learns and behaves within the systems they are part of, reinforcement they experience, interacting with their environment, and aligning themselves with their true values and goals. You can find all of these aspects that contribute to learning in the .  Reference: Apgar, D. 2018. Social Work ASWB Clinical Exam Guide: A Comprehensive Study Guide for Success.

Humans are Designed to be Social: The 8 Stages of Social Development and Their Connection with ABA,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.To some degree, everyone must have a certain level of or certain types of “social skills.”Erik Erikson was one of the first psychologists to explore social development. He believed that a person’s social experiences could impact their sense of self.According to Erikson’s theory, there are 8 stages of social development. By successfully completing each stage of social development, a person continues on their path of healthy social skills and better sense of self.By being open to exploring the 8 stages of social development identified by Erikson, you can help parents better understand where their child is at in the process of developing social skills.One aspect of ABA parent training is about helping educate parents about appropriate and healthy skill development in their child. Social development is one aspect of development that you can guide parents on when you learn more about the broad and sometimes complex skill area known as social development.Let’s explore the 8 stages of social development and identify the way each stage connects with principles of applied behavior analysis.In the first year of life, infants are learning what it means to interact with and rely on other people. They are learning about having trust in someone else especially trust that they can depend on another person to care for them.When children experience the ability to trust another person regularly, they are able to develop a sense of security and be more confident in themselves. When this stage of social development is not successfully experienced, children may end up becoming fearful and untrusting of other people and of the world. This is mainly due to their experiences with inconsistent responding by their primary caregivers.From an ABA (applied behavior analysis) perspective, we can see that, in infancy, children are already beginning to be shaped by their environment. They thrive when they receive consistent and predictable reinforcement. That’s not to say that their every need should be met at every moment but that, as long as the child can rely on getting their basic needs met (including food, safety, hygiene, and attention) in a somewhat predictable manner, they are more likely to successfully accomplish this stage of social development.For instance, it may take mom five minutes to prepare a bottle or a snack even though, in the meantime, the baby may become upset, but if the mom is actively responding to the infant’s needs, the child will experience the ability to rely on the mother for reinforcement.In the toddler years, from about the age of one through the age of three, children are becoming more autonomous. They begin to engage in behaviors that allow them to move away from the close safety net of their primary caregiver. They start to make their own decisions about what activities they like to participate in and how they want to spend their time. They begin making more choices on their own such as what to eat and what to wear.During this stage of social development, a child’s behavior is, in part, for the purpose of giving them more independence while helping them to learn to be less reliant on someone else. A successful experience in this stage involves a child being reinforced for the effort they make to become more independent. When a child is not supported in their attempts to become more independent, they may feel more insecure later in life, they may lack self-confidence, and they may become even more dependent on others.In applied behavior analysis, we want to look at this stage of social development specifically as it relates to how children may want ‘control.’ It is healthy for toddlers and all children to want to have some say into what they do or what happens to them.By allowing and even reinforcing some level of independence in young children, practitioners and parents can help them to learn to manage their own behavior and be less dependent on prompting later in childhood.From the age of three to about six years old, children are asserting themselves even more. They are using their cognitive abilities to think ahead, to plan out activities they want to do, to engage in pretend play, and to learn how to initiate social interactions with other people.When a child is able to display initiative in his life, he is more likely to be able to learn the skill of being a leader as well as developing skills necessary for managing social situations. They can also more easily make decisions and be less reliant on other people to manage their behaviors.If you are working with a family who has a child between the ages of 3 and 6, you may want to consider how the child attempts to display initiative, if their caregivers reinforce their appropriate efforts at displaying initiative, and how you can promote a child’s self-management skills, decision-making skills, and abilities for initiating social interactions as well as navigating those interactions.From the age of 6 through puberty, children are continuing to display behaviors that help them to be independent and separate from their caregivers. However, this stage adds the complex drive for obtaining reinforcement for the things that a child does. They want to be praised or receive attention for or in some way obtain reinforcement for what they do especially when they have put effort into working on or completing a project.During this stage, parents should reinforce their child’s efforts in whatever way makes sense for their child. They can praise the things their child does. They can give the child attention in response to the child showing them something they have completed.By providing positive reinforcement to a child during this stage of social development, parents and practitioners can help strengthen a child’s abilities to set and achieve goals. Goal setting and working towards goals is an important skill from mid-childhood through the rest of a person’s life.Goal setting and accomplishing things can help a child learn to manage his own behaviors. The self-management skills that can be strengthened by successful experiences in this stage can help set the stage for a child being able to monitor and adjust his own behavior.Adolescence brings another set of experiences. This is when the transition between being a child and being an adult begins to take place. As with the other stages, some of the same social skills and behaviors that were present in previous stages are also worked on in this stage. For instance, autonomy, initiative, and goal setting are all skills that are present in adolescence. However, the more prominent and new skill that exists during adolescence is that the individual explores his or her identity.In adolescence, teens are using their cognitive abilities to think about their current and future existence. They explore who they are and what they want in life.Parents should continue to reinforce a child’s appropriate displays of becoming more independent. They should also provide consistent and reliable reinforcement for the teen.This stage of social development relates to a person in their young adulthood years. Their social skills are beginning to include more intimate connections with other people. Although some close relationships were built in adolescence that existed outside of the family, this stage involves more exploration of having relationships outside the family particularly developing or strengthening of long-term relationships.Successful experiences in this stage allow a person to understand the social skill of commitment to others such as through friendships or romantic relationships. They also learn to rely on others for security and the experience of being cared for.You may provide direct services to some young adults in applied behavior analysis services. Or, you may work with parents in this young adulthood stage who have a child whose behavior you are attempting to change.When you work with a young adult who is your primary client, you should consider how their social relationships are in terms of their ability to develop and maintain connections. It is important, however, not to overgeneralize. Not everyone will require the same amount of social connections in order to successfully experience the social development that comes in this stage. Some people may experience optimal social development by having two or three close connections while other people may want more connections particularly if they are more of an extroverted (rather than an introverted) personality type.If your client is a parent who is in the young adulthood stage and your intervention is to provide parent training to them so they can ultimately modify their child’s behavior, you may still want to consider the natural supports that they have in their social life. When people have absolutely no connections, they may experience depression or loneliness or simply a lack of ability to keep up on all the tasks required of them. These negative experiences can make it more difficult for them to help their child or even to participate in your treatment. Exploring their natural social supports can help you identify strengths in their life which can help them learn to rely on those supports for security and care when they need it.Middle adulthood is when many people become more settled into their career or decide on not having a career. They become more settled into their relationships. They may have children (although some people may have had children in their young adulthood years). They become a bit clearer on their place in the world. They might even participate more in the community and contribute to larger projects such as through religious or volunteer activities. Generally, people in middle adulthood look for a purpose to their days and want to have some level of productivity in how they spend their life.From an ABA perspective, people in middle adulthood want to create and see the products that come from their behavior. They also want to find meaning and create a life based on their values.If you are providing direct service to a person in middle adulthood, you may want to help them explore their current status and where they would like to be as it relates to career, relationships, family, and activities.If you work with a parent in the middle adulthood stage, you might explore their experiences related to their career, their family life, their social relationships, and their choice of activities outside the home. Again, it is important to identify strengths and resources that are present for the parents you work with to help them live their best life. By exploring strengths and available resources as well as potential barriers in a parent’s life, you can help that parent identify how they are currently providing or how they would like to be providing their energy and resources to their child particularly as it relates to the child’s treatment recommendations.When a parent is not fulfilled in their life situation or if they don’t have adequate resources, they may not be performing at their optimal ability to help their child particularly in the area of following through on treatment recommendations.You may want to consider similar topics if you are working with a grandparent who is the primary care provider for a child.On a side note, it is important to remember that you are not a therapist or social worker (unless you are and this is the role you are working in). With that being said, if a discussion about the parent’s life satisfaction, status, or other experiences gives you a sense that the parent may benefit from further work in that area, it may be helpful if you recommend or refer them to a therapist or counselor.This stage relates to older adults. Typically, ego integrity versus despair occurs toward the retirement years. People often look back at their life. They feel a sense of integrity when they are satisfied by how they spent their life. Otherwise, they may experience despair or depression.You may or may not have clients in this stage. You may work with some parents or even grandparents who are in this stage or who are approaching this stage of social development.One of the best things that you can do from an ABA perspective is to help reinforce the individual’s efforts particularly as it relates to the caregiving that they have and continue to provide for the identified child. You might also find community resources or make referrals for the person to help them address any potential barriers they may be experiencing, such as health concerns, loneliness, or desire to find long-term planning for the child.Although the above discussed stages of social development were not originally developed from an ABA framework, we can see that they can be explored from an ABA lens.Social development is a lifelong process. People learn to be both independent and interdependent throughout their life. They do this through the various stages of social development.By understanding the 8 stages of social development, you may better understand the place in life that parents and children are experiencing. You may even learn more about your own behavior by looking into how you experience the stages of social development now, in the past, and in the future.Reference: Apgar, D. 2018.

For instance, someone with Level 1 ASD, or someone who is higher functioning, may not become too overwhelmed by their social difficulties until middle childhood or adolescence when social life becomes more complex.“The American Psychiatric Association's  (DSM) is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria designed to facilitate more reliable diagnoses of these disorders….DSM is intended to serve as a practical, functional, and flexible guide for organizing information that can aid in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.” (American Psychiatric Association, DSM-5 Task Force, 2013).According to the DSM-5 (2013), autism spectrum disorder includes the following characteristics [slight modifications made from DSM-5 text for the purposes of simplifying language]:1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (examples include: difficulties approaching others, difficulty initiating and maintaining a conversation, reduced level of sharing of interests and emotions with others, failure to appropriately respond to others in a social situation)2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (examples include: difficulties integrating verbal and nonverbal communication, lack of appropriate eye contact, abnormalities in body language or using gestures, lack of appropriate facial expressions)3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (Examples include: difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts, difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends, absence of interest in peers)1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (Examples include: simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases)2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (Examples include: extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat the same food every day)3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (Examples include: strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests)4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (Examples include: apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement)The DSM-V also identifies three different levels of autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is defined by severity levels within the DSM-V diagnostic criteria. A person with an ASD diagnosis can be at a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3.The levels of ASD include:Level 1: Requires SupportLevel 2: Requires Substantial SupportLevel 3: Requires Very Substantial SupportA person’s level of ASD can actually change over time or depending on the situation they are currently in. However, when diagnosed with ASD, one general Level is designated to describe the person’s overall level of functioning.Autism spectrum disorder is known as a spectrum because each of the characteristics of ASD can vary greatly.Spectrum is defined as, “a broad range of varied but related ideas or objects, the individual features of which tend to overlap so as to form a continuous series or sequence (Spectrum, n.d.).” Spectrum, as in the phrase autism spectrum disorder, has to do with how a particular behavior or characteristic can vary from person to person. The characteristic can be anywhere on a continuum in terms of how it is experienced by the person. For instance, if a person struggles with communicating verbally, this characteristic of ASD may be anywhere from a person not being able to speak at all to a person having difficulty with thinking of the right word to use in some situations.When considering what ASD means, it can also be helpful to understand that a “disorder” is not a term that is good or bad. It is simply an explanatory term that summarizes a set of characteristics or behaviors that a person may experience.So, by using the term ‘disorder’ in the phrase autism spectrum disorder, this is referring to how the diagnosis of ASD includes a set of characteristics or behaviors that typically make up a person who would qualify as having autism spectrum disorder. Generally, this means that a person with ASD has a cluster of certain behaviors related to social skills, communication skills, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors.As mentioned, in 2013, the DSM-V defined ASD as a disorder which included the symptoms above. Prior to 2013, autism was defined slightly differently. Additionally, there were multiple conditions that now make up what is known as autism spectrum disorder.The present day diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder includes the previous diagnoses of autism, Asperger’s syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Although the term Asperger’s may still be used, people with this condition are likely to be diagnosed with ASD if they were to be reevaluated today. Asperger’s is currently thought of as a mild form of autism (Mayo Clinic, 2018).The CDC reports that one in 59 children have autism spectrum disorder (CDC).ASD can often be diagnosed in early childhood. There are typically early signs that suggest a child may have autism spectrum disorder. Early signs of ASD can often be seen as early as one year old or even earlier for some children. Some children may meet typical developmental milestones in the first year of life and then begin to regress in skills of communication or social abilities in the second year of life.ASD begins in early childhood and can create mild to severe difficulties in functioning throughout a person’s lifetime (Mayo Clinic, 2018).Although the characteristics of ASD can be present at any age and can certainly look different at any time throughout life, some early signs of autism that could be seen between 18 months and three years of age include:No big smiles, especially that are in the context of social interactionsNo back-and-forth sharing of soundsNo engagement in copying facital expressionsNot responding to their nameNot using gestures like pointing or wavingNot speaking (especially by 16 months) or losing language skillsASD is more common in males than females. It is diagnosed three to four times more often in boys than in girls (American Psychiatric Association).Research suggests that the symptoms of ASD may look different in girls as compared to how they look in boys.It's possible that females are able to mask their symptoms more effectively than males. They can learn to imitate their peers to try to fit in or at least not stand out too much. Also, females who have average or above average IQ can use their intelligence to evaluate their surroundings and develop coping skills and mimic what other people are doing even if it doesn’t really suit what they would prefer to be like. Females who are higher functioning may also be able to get through school and other settings without triggering an adult to push for an ASD evaluation by finding activities to focus on that don’t bother other people or that don’t make them stand out. For instance, their special interest may be reading or doing academic activities, which may not stand out as too odd to teachers or parents.Some females may express restrictive or repetitive behaviors, one of the characteristics of ASD, in ways that don’t attract much attention, such as picking their skin or fingernails or twirling their hair.Some females with ASD may be seen as shy or introverted which is often more acceptable in many cultures than it is in males.Although there is more public attention given to children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD is a lifelong experience for those who have it.Early intervention is recommended. If a child is suspected of having characteristics of ASD, it is recommended that they receive intervention, in some way, as early as possible. This is so they can have the best potential chance to develop the skills and foundation needed to support independence and quality of life in childhood and adulthood.In middle childhood and adolescence (or in the school-age years), it is important to utilize supports like an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) so that the child is provided with helpful resources and interventions that support their learning and development.As a child reaches and goes through the teenage years, it is important for their parents, teachers, and service providers to consider helping them develop skills and access resources to prepare for adulthood.People with ASD are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed compared to the general population. They may also be less likely to further their education, that is unless a particular type of education is related to their special interests. They are also less likely to participate in community or social activities (CDC).Quality of life is important at every stage of development; However, it is of utmost importance in adulthood. The focus for adult individuals with ASD should be helping them live life as independently as possible in a way that is appropriate for them as well as helping them to strengthen the quality of their life (CDC).Other things to address in adulthood for individuals with autism spectrum disorder include employment, relationships, family, community experiences, and personal values.The cause of ASD is not known. ASD can affect people of all races, nationalities, and socioeconomic status. ASD can be present in people from all walks of life.There are certain factors that increase a person’s risk for having ASD. Risk factors that may make it more likely that someone will have the characteristics of ASD include:Being a male; As mentioned above, boys are diagnosed with ASD four times more often than girlsHaving a family member with ASDHaving certain medical conditions, such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Rett syndromeBeing born premature, especially before 26 weeks gestation, or having very low birth weightHaving older parents (although more research needs to be done to confirm this as a potential risk factor) (Mayo Clinic, 2018)Having been exposed to the prescription drugs valproic acid and thalidomide in utero (CDC, 2020)Research suggests that genes and environmental factors interact to lead to a diagnosis of ASD. A person is likely born with a predisposition to having the characteristics of ASD while environmental factors play a role in how those characteristics are developed over time.The above risk factors are just some factors that research has found to be correlated with a person having ASD. This doesn’t mean that anyone with one of the above factors will have ASD or that there aren’t other causes for ASD.Most doctors will screen children for ASD at a regular checkup. If the child seems to have signs of ASD, the doctor may make a referral to a specialist who is experienced in diagnosing ASD.This specialist will perform an evaluation to assess the child’s behaviors and functioning more closely. This is typically completed with a combination of observing the child, interacting with the child by having them do certain activities, and interviewing the child’s parents.Autism spectrum disorder is a term that is used to describe a set of general characteristics or behaviors that a person experiences that can result in difficulties in their day to day lives. More specifically, people with ASD experience certain social and communication skill differences compared to the general population. They also have restrictive or repetitive behaviors.You may also be interested in these other resources:Join our email list to get access to other content and resources to be notified when the ONLINE COURSE FOR PARENTS OF KIDS WITH ASD is openGet the which offers 27 lessons that parents can use to help their child (This is an ebook that can be used with the guidance of a professional or as a self-guided tool for parents)Professionals can join the  for exclusive access to trainings, materials, and support to develop their knowledge and skills as an ABA parent trainer.

Cognitive Development: How We Think and What that Means in ABA,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Thinking….This isn’t a topic often discussed in the ABA world. However, it plays a big part in how we all function in everyday life.Cognitive development is a broad category of skills that we obtain throughout life that helps us to have thoughts and make sense of the world.Cognitive development is about how we take in information from our environment, how we process that information, how we learn language, and how we make sense of what happens around us and within us.Cognitive development happens to all of us. Cognitive development involves the process of learning to think and understand.In some ways, cognitive development is based on your genetic predisposition or what you are born able to do in terms of cognitive abilities. In other ways, cognitive development is influenced by the learning experiences that you have throughout your lifetime – from birth to the time you pass away.For people with disabilities, some cognitive skills may not come as easily and sometimes, some cognitive skills may not come at all. However, there is hope in that the environment can influence behavior including internal behavior such as cognitive skills.Cognitive skills can be categorized into six levels. These include:Knowledge is the first level of cognitive skills. Knowledge refers to memorization, recognizing, and recalling facts.Knowledge is often the level at which many ABA programs are designed such as to teach kids to name common objects, to teach children to memorize math facts, to teach kids to say “the right things” in certain social situations, and so on.Knowledge is a good skill to have and ABA programming should be individualized to the learner you are working with. If you are providing ABA parent training, you would want to help the parent identify what areas their child could improve upon when it comes to knowledge.Comprehension is more advanced than simply having knowledge of something. Comprehension refers to really understanding what the memorized information means.Can the individual tell you in his own words what something means? Can he put multiple stimuli or facts together to create something new based on their meaning?In ABA parent training, you may need to guide parents on how to expand their child’s abilities from simply having knowledge of something to being able to comprehend it.Application goes even beyond comprehension. Application refers to using the facts or ideas in the correct manner.Can the individual apply what he knows?In ABA parent training, this skill is often present in the form of generalizing a learner’s skills to new stimuli or new situations. You may help a parent identify ways that their child can apply their knowledge in natural environment opportunities.Analysis is the fourth level of cognitive skills. Analysis allows a person to break down information and think more about the information by assessing its parts.For instance, can a child take information from a page in a book and talk about specific parts of that page? Can a child see a completed math problem and explain how all the numbers work together? Can a child tell you the separate parts in a sequence of events and why they are important?A parent can use analysis to evaluate their child’s behaviors. They can break their child’s behavior into separate incidents and then evaluate the occurrences of behavior through ABC (antecedent-behavior-consequence) analysis. They might create a task analysis for their child to help them learn a new skill.Analysis can be a complex skill. A parent may need help finding ways to teach their child to use the advanced cognitive skill of analysis.Synthesis is somewhat the opposite of analysis. The synthesis level of cognition involves combining information to make something new.Can a child combine words to make a new sentence? Can a parent take behavioral concepts and use them in a new way?Evaluation is the sixth and highest level of cognition. Evaluation refers to forming a subjective interpretation of information that one has access to or an experience they had.Evaluation requires a person to create and use their own opinion.Can a child give his opinion on something and provide explanations for why he feels that way? Can a parent thoughtfully express their opinion on a treatment recommendation?Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, developed a framework for how people expand their cognitive abilities. He identified four stages of cognitive development which help us to understand how we acquire knowledge and primarily how we develop our cognitive abilities through interactions with the environment.The sensorimotor stage of cognitive development occurs between birth and two years old.Some examples of what happens at this stage of cognitive development include being able to retain an image of an object and understanding that its still around even when its hidden, logical understanding of how to manipulate objects, engaging in purposeful actions to obtain an outcome, imitating the playful actions of others, making associations between stimuli and/or events such as when mom puts her coat on, she will probably be leaving, and understanding the meaning of words along with other language development.In this stage, children use their senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch) and their motor abilities to interact with and learn about their world.Even in infancy, children are learning through behavioral concepts such as pairing, reinforcement, imitation, observational learning, tacting, manding, and much more.The preoperational stage of cognitive development occurs between the years of two and seven.Some examples of what happens at this stage of cognitive development includethe development of basic abstract thinking abilities but mostly concrete thinkingthe understanding of the past, present, and futurehaving dreams or night terrorsexpanded language development – making meaning of wordsimaginative play and magical thinkingthinking that is mostly focused on the selfIf you work with children between the ages of two and seven or if you work with their parents such as by providing ABA parent training, consider the following tips:A child’s thought process is generally focused on what is in it for them or how something impacts them, so helping them to see how their behavior or another person’s behavior affects them can be helpful. You could use behavioral mapping and include outcomes that influence them when exploring consequences to their behavior.Using simple calendar or schedule systems is helpful since kids in this stage are beginning to understand and be able to think about moments outside of just the here and now.Having some sleep difficulties can be seen as “normal” but if sleep difficulties become too concerning, consult with a professional who specializes in this area.At this stage, kids are often expanding on their language abilities. Encourage a parent to reinforce a child’s efforts to speak no matter what the child’s verbal abilities are. Recommend that parents model and practice using words with their child. For instance, parents can point out stimuli and label things in their environment.Pretend play is common in this stage. Teaching a child to use toys or items in an imaginative way can expand his cognitive abilities.The concrete operational stage occurs between the ages of seven and eleven.At this stage, some common experiences include:More advanced abstract thoughtGreater awareness of rulesBecoming more aware of cause and effectUnderstanding of logical situations or explanationsThinking outside of the here and nowBehavior that aligns with rules or logic that makes sense to the childChildren in this stage are better able to understand rules and logical explanations. It is important for parents to be consistent with following through on expectations and rules. Children might also make up their own rules such as in social games or about their personal belongings. You can help teach children about appropriate behavior by using their ability to recognize cause and effect when exploring target behaviors in imaginary or real-life situations.The formal operations stage of cognitive development occurs from the age of 11 through adulthood.This stage of cognitive development includes:Being able to think more abstractlyBeing able to think about and plan for the futureThinking about “what ifs” or thinking hypotheticallyLearning about the roles and responsibilities of adults and/or of a mature, responsible adolescentIn ABA, you can help parents to guide their children as they explore their responsibilities and their goals. Practitioners and parents can help adolescents to learn about goal setting and being responsible while also thinking about outcomes that could happen by making certain choices.We have explored the six levels of cognition (or how we think and understand) as well as the four stages of cognitive development. Although this information is primarily about how we use our brain, or the mind, to think and process our world, these ideas are applicable to ABA.By understanding where an individual is at in their level of cognitive abilities or their stage of cognitive development, you can better design your ABA interventions by being more mindful of typical development. You can also help parents in your ABA parent training services to guide their children through these levels and stages in a way that aligns with the child’s current level of functioning and/or with the child’s expected developmental level based on their age.Reference: Apgar, D. 2018.

Using Response Interruption and Redirection (RIR) to Reduce Stereotypy,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.  Response interruption and redirection, or RIR, can be used to reduce vocal stereotypy. Vocal stereotypy is common (but does not always occur) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.The interruption part of RIR is about interrupting the vocal stereotypy. To do this, another person engages with the individual by asking them a question or giving a verbal demand that is likely to result in accurate responding. After the demand is placed, reinforcement is provided based upon the individual’s response.RIR is supported by research and is an evidence-based practice for children with autism spectrum disorder. Research suggests that RIR is most effective with individuals who have at least some basic functional language skills and who can respond accurately to at least some demands that involve responding with vocalizations.RIR can be taught to parents, teachers, and therapists to help children reduce vocal stereotypy.Stereotypy, or stereotypic behavior, is behavior that includes any repetitive response. Stereotypy can involve motor behaviors like hand flapping or rocking or it can involve vocal behaviors like repeating words, sounds, or phrases or even the act of humming specifically when it does not serve a social function.Stereotypy is reinforced by the automatic sensory stimulation that is produced by the repetitive response.Stereotypic behavior is common in even typically developing young children and even in some adults. However, the difference between this type of behavior in typically developing individuals and individuals with ASD is that stereotypy in individuals with ASD tends to be more persistent, more intense, and more difficult to stop. Sometimes, stereotypic behaviors can interfere with learning or with relationships which is when consideration should be given to whether the stereotypic behavior should be reduced or eliminated.RIR involves two parts.The stereotypic behavior is interrupted as soon as possible after it begins to occur. Interruption can be used on motor or vocal stereotypy.The student is redirected to other alternative and appropriate behaviors.Vocal stereotypy can be interrupted by providing a demand that involves a highly likely response will occur that is based on vocalizations. The idea is that if the individual displays the appropriate verbal response, they are no longer able to engage in vocal stereotypy because of engaging in an incompatible behavior.To interrupt vocal stereotypy, you can ask the person a question or to engage in a verbal response. It is helpful for the demand to make sense for the situation. For instance, if the child is sitting at the table while the family is gathered together to eat and they begin to engage in vocal stereotypy, RIR could include asking the child an appropriate question given the context, such as “How do you like the dinner?” or “How was your day?” or “What is your favorite food?”The parent can then reinforce the child’s appropriate vocal behavior by providing praise, validation, and responding in a socially acceptable manner. This approach may also have the benefit of giving the child more positive reinforcement experiences with expressing socially acceptable verbalizations which can then lead to more appropriate vocalizations which can lead to greater opportunities in relationships and everyday social encounters. RIR involves three basic steps. These include:Gaining the child’s attention once the stereotypy starts (the parent could say the child’s name, touch their shoulder, or do something else that would get the child to attend to them)Ask the child a question or give a demand/direction that would require either a verbal or motor response typically incompatible with the stereotypic behavior. The demand should be easy for the child and likely to occur.Reinforce the child’s attempt at giving an appropriate response. Parents can learn to use RIR to help reduce their child’s stereotypic behavior.It is important to gather a parent’s perspective on whether they would like to reduce their child’s stereotypy or not. Also, take into consideration clinical recommendations when deciding when and how much to reduce stereotypy.Stereotypy itself is not a bad thing as many people, even typically developing individuals, engage in stereotypic behaviors. It may become concerning when the stereotypy interferes with learning or relationships that are identified as significant to the individual.A few tips on training parents to use RIR include:Provide the parent a written checklist or outline for how to implement RIRModel the use of RIR for the parent, preferably directly with the child who displays the stereotypic behaviorProvide parents an opportunity to practice using RIR with their child while you observe them and then give them compassionate feedback on their use of RIR, specifically based upon the written checklist of the procedure.Be sure to also reinforce a parent’s successes and to validate their concerns about the procedure. Collaborate with parents on the benefits of using RIR to reduce stereotypy but also be sure to only attempt to reduce stereotypy when it interferes with the client’s quality of life and is identified as a socially significant issue for the client and/or his or her caregiver. Reference:Sheehey, P.

Factors that Influence Human Behavior: What May be Affecting the Behavior of Parents You Serve,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.When you work with parents, it is important to keep an open mind and understand that there are complex factors that influence their behaviors (as well as your own behaviors).Consider the following factors that may be playing a role in the behaviors that your clients are displaying and how those individuals are functioning in their day to day lives.This might help you to develop greater insight into potential resources and/or barriers that play a role in how parents are able to participate in services or follow through with treatment suggestions.These are differences that are specific to the person you are working with. Individual characteristics are part of the reason why two people can perceive and respond to a situation differently. Individual characteristics include things like knowledge, belief systems, personality characteristics, and general disposition. This also includes things like the person’s learning history specifically as it relates to experiences with reinforcement and punishment.These are factors that relate to a person’s social interactions. Examples of interpersonal factors include a person’s social support network, relationships with other people, and a person’s religious or spiritual relations. Rule-governed behavior may be influenced by social expectations.These are factors that relate to the rules, regulations, and informal structures that exist within an organization or community that the client works or lives. Institutional factors can influence a person’s behavior through the rules and expectations placed on them such as how to dress, how to interact with others, and expectations related to appropriate habits and behaviors. Rule-governed behavior as well as behavior that is impacted by direct consequences may be influenced by institutional factors.This relates to the environment where your client lives. People’s behavior can directly or indirectly be influenced by the available resources in their community as well as by the norms placed upon them by society.This refers to factors that relate to the regulations and laws that influence a person’s behaviors and lifestyle. This can influence behaviors in a variety of ways from parenting strategies used to views on disabilities and much more.Consider these various factors that can play a role in how your clients behave and how they experience day to day life. Some factors may be similar to the influences that impact your behavior while other factors may be different. Human behavior is complex. Many of the factors discussed can interact in complex ways leading to different influences on your clients’ behaviors.Reference: Apgar, D. 2018.

Training for Parent Trainers: ABA Parent Training Membership Program,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Professionals who provide parent training services, especially parent training that is based on applied behavior analysis, can benefit from continuous learning in the area of ABA parent training.As with many fields that provide human services, continuous learning is important to help the professional learn up-to-date information in their area of practice. It helps the professional to continue to improve their skill set and provide quality services.Behavior analysts have certain ethical obligations that encourage them to participate in continuous learning opportunities of some sort.For instance, lets review some items form the BACB Professional and Ethical Compliance Code that recommend behavior analysts participate in continuous learning. If a behavior analyst provides parent training, they need to be sure to engage in continuous learning in that area, as well.Ethics Items that Encourage Behavior Analysts to Participate in a Learning Program:1.01 Reliance on scientific knowlege1.02 Boundaries of competence1.03 Maintaining competence through professional development2.09 Treatment/intervention efficacy4.01 Conceptual consistencyThese items from the compliance code are just some examples of the need for behavior analysts to continue to learn new things in the field and in the areas in which they practice.Most behavior analysts participate in CEUs or continuing education opportunities. I might add that it is important to continue to learn and enhance your skills even outside of the formalized CEU opportunities.For instance, reading a book, reviewing research studies, following credible sources online, and things like that can help you to continue to strengthen your skills.We offer CEUs as well as other training opportunities for professionals who provide ABA-based parent training.

Basic ABA Concepts - ABA Parent Training Topic Idea,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.In applied behavior analysis parent training services, it is helpful to review basic concepts of the field of ABA with parents. This will help them to have a better understanding of ABA and help them to learn more about the services their child is receiving as well as how to utilize ABA strategies at home.To introduce ABA concepts to parents of children with autism spectrum disorder, you may want to provide an easy to understand definition of the concept and also provide examples of how the concept is used with their child in ABA or how the parent could use the concept in the home. You could also help the child learn about the concept by demonstrating the concept in a real-life or role-play situation.ABA concepts can apply to any type of animal or human behavior. This is an idea that can be helpful to share with parents that you work with. It is recommended that behavior analysts inform parents that ABA concepts can be beneficial to everyone and that ABA has been proven as an evidence-based practice for children with autism spectrum disorder.Positive reinforcement is when a stimulus occurs immediately after a behavior and then that behavior happens more often in the future.: A child asks his father for some candy multiple times. The father gives in and lets the child have the candy. If asking repeatedly for candy (or other desired items) happens more often in the future, then this is an example of positive reinforcement.Negative reinforcement is when a stimulus is removed immediately following a behavior and then that behavior happens more often in the future.In the previous example, negative reinforcement occurs for the father if he gives in more often as a result of the child’s repeated asking for a preferred item.DRA is providing positive reinforcement to behaviors that you would like to see instead of the maladaptive behavior.In the candy example above, the father could use DRA to reduce or eliminate the child’s nagging by no longer providing candy in response to repeatedly asking (meaning to no longer give in to his nagging for candy). Additionally, he should provide positive reinforcement for behaviors he would like to see instead (alternative behaviors). He could provide candy to the child if the child uses his manners and talks with an appropriate voice and says, “May I please have some candy?” or he could provide candy if the child displays alternative behavior, such as sharing with his siblings or behaving well (objectively defined) in the grocery store.Extinction is when the reinforcement that was maintaining a behavior is no longer provided. When using extinction, it is recommended to use reinforcement for a behavior you would rather see instead.In the above example, the father can use extinction by not giving the child what he or she wants when the child asks repeatedly.When using extinction, the behavior you are targeting is likely to increase in frequency, duration, or intensity temporarily. When reinforcement is no longer provided for a particular behavior, the child may display that behavior even more for a period of time.When the father puts his child’s repeated asking on extinction, the child will most likely ask for the preferred item even more for a while to see if the dad will eventually give in. The father should continue to put the repeated asking on extinction (not give in to the behavior) and then the behavior is likely to decrease. However, it is important to note that if there is another function rather than access to the tangible item for repeated asking, simply not providing the item may not be effective. Always consider the function of the behavior.JUST $9.99 A MONTH TO ADVERTISE YOUR SERVICES.Chaining is breaking a larger task into smaller steps. Using chaining can help a child learn a more complex skill. It can also help the behavior analyst or parent identify areas that the child could use more help with.Teaching a child to brush his teeth can be broken down into smaller steps. The detail of the chain should be based on the individual child and their learning needs and abilities. The chain may include steps, such as picking up the toothbrush, opening the toothpaste, putting the toothpaste on the toothbrush, putting the cap back on the toothpaste, brushing the different areas of the teeth, etc.Shaping is when reinforcement is provided for closer and closer approximations to the ultimate behavior goal.When a parent teaches a child to brush his teeth, shaping can be used to teach the child to scrub his teeth more thoroughly as he gets better at the skill.“Motivating operations (MO) are environmental variables that alter the effectiveness of some stimulus, object, or event as a reinforcer. They alter the current frequency of all behavior that has been reinforced by that stimulus, object, or event. (ABA: MO).A child has not played on any electronic device all day, so by the afternoon he is more likely to comply with requests if he can early electronic time as a result.Response effort refers to the effort that is required to carry out a behavior. When a behavior takes more response effort, a person is generally less likely to show that behavior. As the response effort decreases, a person will be more likely to engage in that behavior. A child will probably clean his room if it is less messy because it takes less response effort as compared to if the room is extremely messy and requires more response effort.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Materials to Use in ABA Parent Training: What Can You Do in ABA Parent Training Besides Worksheets?,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Although worksheets come in handy and create a structured and easily accessible guide for ABA parent training sessions, sometimes it is also appropriate to use other materials and supplies in session to help teach a particular idea or to help generalize a skill being taught to the natural environment.Consider the list below for ideas on what you can use in ABA (applied behavior analysis) parent training sessions that are not just worksheets.As a service provider, you may want to teach parents about helping a child to improve his communication skills. For kids with limited vocal language abilities, using pictures to communicate is one possibility.You might consider having a picture communication system on hand to use when applicable, providing the client a communication system as part of his treatment, or having the parent purchase a communication program that you can help them implement with their child.One example of a set of picture icons that could be used for  is found at National Autism Resources.It is recommended that service providers help parents learn to use effective strategies that will help improve their child’s ability to independently and efficiently navigate daily activities and daily routines.To do this, having materials that promote these skills is helpful. For instance, visual supports are an evidence-based strategy to use particularly for kids with autism.You may consider getting a  or daily routine of some sort for the child to help them learn to be more independent with their daily activities.Daily living skills are one of the most important skills that a child should learn.Parents are the most influential people in a child’s life when it comes to who is likely to have the most impact on a child’s progress with daily living skills.Because of this, service providers have the ability to support parents in their efforts to help their children develop these skills. To do so, finding materials that will promote daily living skills is recommended.For instance, a can help many kids learn to become toilet trained. Since parents spend a lot of time with their child, they can work on toileting with the child in the natural environment as well as across numerous learning opportunities.Another thing that could be helpful is to have an easy-to-use cookbook. A  with pictures and easy recipes can be used with a parent and their child to help promote cooking skills. A service provider may want to model to the parent how to use a cookbook to teach the child to independently cook simple dishes.You could use these to help model to parents how to support a child’s fine motor skills particularly to teach buttoning, lacing, zipping, and snapping.We have covered some ideas for materials that you can use in applied behavior analysis (ABA) parent training. Other service providers are also likely to find the recommendations above helpful.

BST in ABA Parent Training: ABA Training for Parents to Improve Their Child's Social Skills,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Social skills are an essential component of living a quality life. Although no one needs to be just like anyone else, having certain social skills even if those skills are expressed in an individual’s own way, is important to living a high quality of life.Parents have the ability to guide their children in countless areas of life - one of those areas being the realm of social skills.One research study explored how effective it could be to teach parents via a behavioral skills training method on how to teach their kids certain social skills.The study used a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across parent–child dyads. Additionally, direct observation allowed the researchers to assess parent and child behaviors.Using behavioral skills training to teach parents how to help their children improve social skills was effective in this study. The children improved on trained and untrained social skills.Parents have the ability to help their children with generalization and maintenance of skills learned such as the social skills that many children with ASD (and even other diagnoses like ADHD) are likely to experience.Parents have the opportunity to help kids practice and improve their social skills in a variety of settings, with a variety of other people, and for a variety of different situations.The researchers report the significance of having parents help their children with social skills. Particularly, they can help their child contact naturally occurring reinforcers which helps to reinforce and maintain newly learned skills.Behavioral skills training is a method of teaching someone a new skill.Behavioral skills training - or BST - includes the following four steps:InstructionsModelingRole-PlayFeedbackBST can be used in ABA training for parents to help parents learn an effective method for how to teach their children new skills.BST has been used as an effective and time-limited option for teaching new skills.BST has been found to be an effective method for using in ABA parent training. ABA training for parents that includes the use of BST has the benefit of using this effective methodology for not only helping the parent learn how to teach their child but also to help the child, indirectly, to learn new skills through the ABA parent training services.In the study by Dogan, et. al. (2017), four parent-child dyads participated in the intervention.There were particular characteristics of the children in the study including having an IQ over 70, having a diagnosis of autism disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified, attendance in at least one general education class, and passing a “pre-treatment compliance check.”To assess social skills abilities and deficits of kids, the researchers used the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist - Parent Report Form as well as the Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS).Parents were given a BST handout which was based off a resource in the book: This study’s ABA training for parents primarily looked at the dependent measure of the percentage of BST steps that each parent completed correctly.The researchers also measured the percentage of steps of a social skill displayed correctly by the child. Specifically, they looked at the social skills of joining in a conversation and asking for help.Interobserver agreement and procedural integrity (two concepts found within ABA) were part of this research study.ABA also includes use of various experimental designs. In the case of this research study, a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was used.Parents were provided with initial training, maintenance probe, subsequent training, and follow-up sessions. Sessions varied in length of time.Vignettes were used to provide scenario examples for parents to practice the BST skills.To learn more about the procedures and methods completed within this study, see the research study article as listed at the end of this article.As a result of the research study, all parents increased in their ability to display accurate teaching steps according to the BST training provided for their child’s social skills.Even the children in the study improved their social skills due to the parents implementation of BST strategies.Generalization, maintenance, and social validity - other ABA concepts - were addressed in this research study, as well.Social skills improvements generalized to particular social skills that were not specifically trained. Generalization also occurred for parents in that they could use the BST model to teach their child a new social skill that they had not specifically had training to teach.Maintenance of skills was also present in follow-up analysis.Parents reported high social validity of the BST training procedure and strategies used to help their children learn new social skills.In summary, behavioral skills training (instructions, modeling, role-play, and feedback) can be used to teach parents how to teach their kids new skills. This can provide parents with an effective tool that they can use to help their kids continue to learn new skills even outside treatment services. The findings that the BST skills were generalized and maintained and that the children’s social skills improved supports this idea.For  on providing parent training services, check out this great  or .You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Using Visual Supports in ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Visual supports can be an effective tool for helping children with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and other behavioral or learning challenges to improve skills in various ways. Using visual supports is an evidence-based practice (Sam, 2015).A visual support is one way of communicating with people through the use of pictures or other visual stimuli. Using visual supports is often recommended for individuals who struggle in the area of receptive language, multi-step tasks, and independent functioning. There are many other examples of benefits that could be gained from the use of visual supports, as well. For instance, people with executive functioning skill weaknesses (such as working memory or organization) may benefit from the use of visual supports.Visual supports can be divided into three categories (Autism Speaks, 2011).Visual Boundaries (visually defining the space where an activity occurs)Visual Cues (i.e. graphic organizers or visual instructions)Visual Schedules (visual display of a schedule or routine)Within the three categories of visual supports, examples of strategies that could be used in visual support interventions include the ideas listed in the table below (Autism Speaks, 2011; Sam, 2015).Pictures or imagesRoutines (in a visual format)PhotographsTask analysis (displayed visually   through image or text)ObjectsRules (in a visual format)Written words (text)Reward systems (ex: token board)Lists (checklists, to do lists, etc.)SchedulesFirst-then boardVisual cues in the environmentVisual boundariesMapsLabelsOrganization systemsTimelinesScriptsThere are two main areas that are often addressed with the use of visual supports. Autism Speaks (2011) reports that the two main purposes of using visual supports, especially with children with autism spectrum disorder, but also with children with other types of behavioral and learning challenges include:To help parents (and other adults) communicate more effectively with their childTo help the child communicate more effectively with othersWhen children struggle with receptive language skills, such as understanding verbal information from others, following directions, and comprehending multi-step instructions, visual supports can help.Visual supports help in a variety of ways. Some examples of how visual supports can help include the following:Visual supports allow the person to use the visual stimulus to complete activities of daily living.Visual supports can help improve self-management of social interactions.Visual supports can help the individual understand expectations provided by others as well as social norms.Visual supports can help the individual navigate tasks that require organization and other executive functioning skills.Visual supports can help the individual communicate with others more effectively.Visual supports can improve learning (Bobek & Tversky, 2016).Visual schedules and knowing what to expect is associated with reduced maladaptive behavior.Visual supports can improve decision-making (Bailey, Willner, & Dymond, 2011)Research supports the use of visual supports for children with autism spectrum disorder. For example, one study conducted by Macdonald, Trembath, Ashburner, Costley, and Keen (2018) found that the use of visual schedules helped students to improve on-task behavior. The outcome of this study may be able to apply to parents of children with ASD in that parents could help their child use a visual schedule to improve on-task behavior and comply with expectations and routines in the home. One of the main goals of using visual supports for children is to reduce reliance on adults and increase independence as well as to help the child live an improved quality of life.As a reminder, this article on visual supports is an excerpt from the ‘One-Year ABA Parent Training Curriculum.’ (Get it on or as an electronic document on )In the curriculum, you will also receive a parent training handout that is a summary of this visual support information in a more parent-friendly visual format.Additionally, the curriculum includes a Topic Exploration Form which allows the parent training session to focus on visual supports.Last but not least, the visual supports lesson in the curriculum (along with every other lesson) includes a homework activity that the parent can be given related to the topic.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

You can have them pay for their services with cash or credit instead of dealing with insurance companies.Deciding what to name your business can be tricky, but this is a good place to start. Consider what your business stands for, consider what sets you apart, and brainstorm words and phrases that resonate with you.There are multiple options for deciding where you’d like to create your base for your parent training business.You may choose any of the following:Renting office space or subleasing space in a local building (and having parents come to you for their parent training services)Offering strictly telepractice services (so you’d provide parent training via video chat)Providing home-based parent training (where you’d go to the client’s home to provide the parent training)There are multiple ways that you can do this. There are also multiple types of business structures that you could pursue. One of these options is to become an LLC, a limited liability company.This is what SwyftFilings has to say about forming an LLC:“The Limited Liability Company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for ""pass-through"" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.”Consider checking out  to help you get your business paperwork filed and creating your LLC in no time.These numbers are required for some purposes and also help you to separate your business as its own entity.You can get an .You can get an .It is typically recommended to have a business email address rather than using your personal email address for business use.

Additionally, you can have bills and expenses come out of that bank account.This will make managing your business finances much, much easier rather than having your business and personal finances mixed together.Gathering all the necessary documents for your clients can be a challenge or, at the least, a little bit nerve-racking. You want to make sure you have the right paperwork in place ahead of time so that you can feel confident and ready to go when you start seeing clients.Although there may be some differences in the paperwork requirements based upon your location as well as the services you offer and population you work with, some  that you may consider include:Consent for services or service contractNotice of privacy practicesAuthorization to release informationAuthorization for credit card useSocial media policy (this could be its own form or it could be included in the service contract)Intake assessment form(s)Treatment plan templateProgress note (session note) templateAlthough this article is meant to be a guide for behavior analysts (or other professionals) who want to provide parent training, that may not be specific enough to really gain traction and be seen as an expert by your potential clients.Most business developers will tell you that you should specialize. Instead of saying, you will work with any and all parents, try to get at least a little bit more specific.For example, consider the following:Do you want to work with children with autism spectrum disorder who are between the ages of three and six?Do you specialize in working with youth with ASD who are in their adolescence (ages 13-17)?Do you specialize in working with high functioning youth with ASD (Level 1 ASD)? or are you exceptionally knowledgeable about youth with ASD who are lower functioning (Level 3 ASD)?Do you have a background in working with parents and/or their children who have a diagnosis of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)?Do you have a background in psychology or social work and are experienced in co-occurring diagnoses?Maybe you specialize in telehealth services or you will travel to a client’s home (regularly or on occasion)Do you feel confident in your ability to work with parents who have multiple children with ASD? How about parents with multiple children with or without diagnoses?Do you provide parent training for parents of children with general behavioral issues? School issues? Toileting problems? Feeding problems?These are just some ideas for how to really clarify what makes you stand out from every other provider of parent training. Take some time to explore your area of specialty.Although you are sure to be mindful of respecting your competitors in terms of other professionals who are also trying to develop their businesses, it is often beneficial to collaborate with other like-minded people.If you can network with people who have already begun the journey to creating a parent training business or you can have discussions with people who are at a similar spot in their business development journey, you can experience compounding benefits that come from this communication – you can benefit, those you collaborate with can benefit, and parents and families can benefit.Consider joining the  on Facebook to be part of a community of professionals interested in parent training.Take some time to consider how you can make yourself known in your local community. Could you do a presentation at a local daycare or school? Could you have a booth at a fair or community event?Could you pass out flyers to local doctor’s offices or send a flyer home with the students at your local school district?Your rates will likely vary based upon your location, your target audience, and your own personal business and financial goals. There is no one way to figure out your rates, but a general tip for how to begin the thought process behind figuring this out is to consider your ultimate yearly income goal from your parent training business, divide that by 52 weeks minus however many weeks of vacation you’d like to take (or the number of weeks you will likely take off for whatever reason) and divide by the number of parent training hours that you would like to provide in one week.Here is a formula to consider:Here is an example: $80,000 / 48 weeks / 25 hours = $67 per hourOn a side note, you may want to consider adding a bit more to your yearly income goal to account for expenses and taxes. You could also overestimate how many service hours you plan on providing to account for cancellations (unless you plan to have a cancellation fee policy of some sort).With that all taken into consideration, I could set my rate at $75 per hour.You may also want to consider identifying a service hour as truly meaning 50 minutes to allow for 10 minutes of transition between clients. This won’t affect your numbers in terms of using the formula. It will, however, affect your practice. It’s important to make this clear with clients, so they know what to expect.Will you accept cash? check? credit card payments?If you accept credit card payments, how will you accept payment?Maybe you accept payment via PayPal?Identifying how you will accept payments and your payment options for private pay clients ahead of time will help you to be prepared to accept payments in a confident and stress-free manner.This is related to the above recommendation to decide whether you will create your own website or purchase a listing in our Parent Training Service Directory.If you purchase your own website, you will need to purchase additional services to increase your search engine optimization to help you reach potential customers (or do it yourself which takes lots of time and effort and can be a difficult learning curve for some).If you go with the option to be listed in the , you can have this done for you. Your listing in the directory is optimized to increase the likelihood of potential customers coming finding your information and then ultimately contacting you for services.

"3 Tips to Help Parents Connect - or ""Pair"" - with Their Teen with a Disability","Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Although adolescence can be a challenging time for both the child and their parent for any family, when the teen also has a disability, adolescence can bring even more complexity.One of the challenges that may present itself for any parent of a teen is how to really connect with one another. In applied behavior analysis, we would consider how the parent and teen can build rapport or how the parent can pair with their child.Let’s look at some tips for how you can guide parents in their journey of connecting with their teen, specifically for those parents who have a teen with a disability.Regardless of whether the teen is able to speak with vocal language, with a form of picture communication system, or does not express himself through words or images, a parent can pair with their teen by listening to them.To listen, a parent should allow the teen time and space to talk with them. They should be open and non-judgemental when their teen does express themselves. A parent should not jump in too quickly with advice and corrective statements. This may be aversive to the teen which could then impair the rapport building process.Even if a child doesn’t speak with words or images, their behaviors including their physical actions, body language, noises and facial expressions can express the teen’s experiences. In this case, parents can pay attention to these expressive activities to learn more about their child.When anyone tries to “pair” with another person - when they try to improve their relationship or, in the case of a parent or teacher, when they want to improve their relationship AND improve the child’s compliance and participation - it is important to simply be there with the other person.To be there means to spend time with the teen.Spend time with the teen without placing any demands or giving instructions.Spend time with the teen without criticizing or making comments that could indicate you disapprove of the teen in some way.Spend time with the teen by showing interest in them and the activities that they enjoy.Parents can help pair with their teen with a disability by focusing on finding the positive and appropriate behaviors their child engages in.When parents focus on using positive reinforcement often by giving praise, providing reward or preferred items and activities for appropriate behavior, and by simply showing approval for the teen’s good character traits and good behavior, the parent will work on connecting with their child.Although there are many actions a parent can take to pair or connect with their teen with a disability, we have covered three tips to help this process.ListenBe ThereFind the GoodParents can use these three tips to improve their relationship with their teen no matter what abilities or disabilities their child may have.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Recommendations for Helping Teens with ASD  Succeed in General Education & Mainstream School Settings,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.There is definitely research that supports including youth with ASD in the mainstream setting. Students with ASD may experience a number of different benefits when being included in the mainstream setting.Benefits that may be experienced by youth with ASD include:The student displaying more acceptable socially-related behaviors and improvements in overall social skillsThe student being expected to achieve more advanced educational goalsThe student displaying less characteristics of ASD that impact daily functioningThe student being more able to cope with transitions and changeEven though research supports the likelihood that these and other benefits could be experienced by an individual with ASD participating in a mainstream school setting, it is important to consider the individual needs and preferences of each student.Although there is support for including youth with ASD in the mainstream educational setting, sometimes there is a disconnect between the overall goal of including the student and making them fit in with the mainstream classroom and parent or teacher expectations and the best interest of the student in terms of their needs and preferences.Some adolescents with ASD feel socially, emotionally, or physically isolated from their peers in school. They might also feel lonely or even experience bullying at times.Some teens with ASD report feeling unsupported or misunderstood by teachers in school. Students with ASD are 8-20% more likely to be permanently excluded from schools than their peers with no special education needs.Some teens feel that the environment in the school setting isn’t designed to suit their needs regarding their social and sensory experiences. It is important to consider the individual student’s needs and preferences regarding their environment. Sometimes, the student and even their parent might not know exactly what the ideal social or sensory environment would look like for a particular student but it is worth exploring and looking into more consciously.In regard to the social environment, some students with ASD may prefer to have more time alone, others may prefer to have more time to talk with others about their special interests, and others may prefer the social environment to be modified in certain ways. Additionally, some youth with ASD desire to have friendships while others are satisfied with one or even no friends. It is important to be careful about giving off the impression that everyone should have a certain number of friends; instead, it is important to consider the individual’s best interest.Some teens feel anxious or unpleasant emotions before they go to school each day and sometimes throughout the school day, as well. Challenging behaviors and anxiety seem to be higher in youth with ASD than the general population.Although research supports including students with ASD in the mainstream school setting, some individuals may experience a negative impact on their well-being as a result of the mainstream setting.In the study by Goodall (2018) that looked at the perspective of young adults with ASD and their perspective of their personal school experiences, the research identified multiple themes and common experiences amongst the study participants. With their findings, it is recommended to address these themes and consider how each of the themes may impact a student with ASD who is in a school setting today.Common themes of concern about the mainstream school setting from individuals with ASD who had gone through school include:Exclusion in inclusion (feeling excluded even when the goal from the school is to “include” them”Feelings of dread (anxiety, depression, not wanting to go to school)Feelings of isolation (feeling left out, feeling lonely, etc.)Feeling misunderstood (not feeling as though teachers, staff, or peers understand them)Feeling unsupportedSupporting me (not having support as an individual person)Supportive teachers (lack of experiencing support from teachers)Supportive curricula (the way curricula is presented can be problematic, such as when it creates uncomfortable social situations or is too face-paced)Supportive environments (the environment can be overly stimulating or too noisy)“I felt physically, mentally, and emotionally drained.” “I never felt excited, always dread. I would not want to get up, I wouldn’t want to open my eyes. I would wish I was still asleep.”“I felt closed in and like I couldn’t breathe as there were so many people. It was so difficult being in there all day.”“It [mainstream school] is not about them adapting to you, but you adapting to them.”“Actually start caring about the students rather than the results they give you. It is about teaching the children and not only caring for the results. Really knowing and paying attention to the children… each child has their own individual needs.”CONSIDER PROMOTING YOUR SERVICES ON LOCAL AUTISM SERVICES FOR JUST $27/MONTH.Although we will provide some recommendations for helping teens with ASD succeed in the mainstream or general education classroom based upon research findings, it is important not to generalize these recommendations to all teens with ASD. It’s always important to find what works for the individual student and select strategies that will be appropriate for themSome potential strategies that could help teens with ASD include:Having more breaks throughout the school dayBeing in classes with fewer students (smaller class sizes)Having less homeworkInstructions being broken down into smaller and easier to understand stepsProviding visual supports for instructionsBeing able to use technology instead of handwriting when possibleBeing allowed to use alternative methods to mental problem-solving alone (especially with math)Providing written instructions to the student rather than expecting them to remember instructions or expecting them to write down instructions that are told to them verbally while they are also trying to ignore distractionsHaving access to places that make them feel safe when they feel the need to obtain relief from a particular situation or when they feel anxious or overwhelmed. This safe place should be easy to access, predictable, and quiet.Having teachers who would actively listen to their concerns and consider their requests and needsNot having teachers and the school system implement practices that enhance their sense of isolation – such as educating the student separately from the group (whether that’s because the student with ASD can’t find a partner for a two-person activity or because the teacher feels that the student will learn better outside the classroom – unless that is, in fact, the preference of the student)Not being kept inside during recess or lunch times – which can also enhance feelings of isolationTeachers should not assume that a particular strategy is appropriate for all individuals with ASD just because it works for some (for example, using a visual schedule made of icons and Velcro may not be appropriate for an older teen even though there is some credibility in this intervention)Teachers should receive ASD training but they must individualize how they work with and teach each and every student rather than using a “one-size-fits-all” approachThe presence of high yet reasonable expectations to give students with ASD something to strive for while also placing these expectations on the student in a compassionate and understanding manner giving support where needed.More relaxed environment, such as making environmental modifications (like having comfortable seating or changing the layout of the classroom)Although every individual with ASD is different and will experience school in their own way, overall, teens with ASD can be supported through having teachers and staff who understand their needs and preferences, who support them through providing individualized accommodations, and feeling included in ways that make them feel comfortable and accepted (Goodall, 2018).Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder should, to the extent reasonable and possible, be a part of the decision-making process in what types of supports they receive throughout their mainstream educational experiences.Although it is acceptable for parents and teachers to place expectations and limits on all youth including those with ASD, considering the perspectives, needs, and personalities of students with ASD will ultimately help improve their success in the school setting, in life, and hopefully even prevent or reduce symptoms of other behavioral (or mental) health concerns like depression or anxiety.Overall, teens with ASD should be heard and supported. Individualized intervention should be thoroughly considered for each student.If you are a behavior analyst who works with a parent who has an adolescent with autism spectrum disorder and that child is or will be in a mainstream school setting, this article can provide you useful information to share with the parent and/or the teacher during a parent training session or meeting with the teacher or school staff.You could provide our handout on the topic of helping teens with ASD succeed in a mainstream school setting to the parent or teacher for their reference to help guide planning for the school year.

Using ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) in ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Applied behavior analysis has core dimensions and characteristics that define its identity as a field of study and practice.However, in recent years, ABA has grown and developed as does most other fields.One way that ABA is expanding is by incorporating principles related to acceptance and commitment therapy into its practice.Using ACT in ABA can be helpful when working with individuals including youth or adults but it can also be helpful when working with parents who are looking for guidance and training.Review this article for an overview of ACT and how ACT can apply to ABA parent training services.Acceptance and commitment therapy - otherwise known as ACT - is based on relational frame theory which was created based upon human behavior and cognition.ACT and RFT are based on basic behavioral principles and were traditionally used as theoretical models in behavior therapy (Hayes, et. al., 2006).The main goals of acceptance and commitment therapy are to increase psychological flexibility, increase attentiveness to the present moment, and the development of personal values with committed action toward those values (Kowalkowski, 2012).ACT is one of the interventions that are considered to be in the realm of ‘third-wave behavioral therapy.’ Other third-wave behavioral therapies include functional analytic psychotherapy, integrative behavioral couples therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.Third-wave behavior therapies expand upon more traditional behavior therapies like cognitive-behavior therapy and focus on contextual and experiential change strategies, mindfulness, and the acceptance of private experiences (Kowalkowski, 2012).ACT includes six primary processes that are visualized in a tool known as the hexaflex.ACT involves acceptance, mindfulness, commitment, and behavior change.The main goal of ACT is to develop greater psychological flexibility.Psychological flexibility is defined as: “the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to either change or persist when doing so serves valued ends” (Hayes, et al., 2004, p.5 as cited in: Kowalkowski, 2012).The six core processes of ACT include:acceptance - which is the alternative to experiential avoidance and a willingness to be with what cannot change (such as unpleasant emotions)cognitive defusion - stepping back from your own thoughtsself as context - seeing one’s self as both a holding space for thoughts and experiences as well as the self that is connected to personal history, thoughts, and emotionscontact with the present moment - being in the here and nowvalues - identifying what matters most in lifecommitted action - acting in ways that are connected with one’s valuesAcceptance and commitment therapy is becoming more well-known as a potential beneficial addition to traditional applied behavior analysis services. However, there is still much to learn and much to expand upon in regards to integrating ACT with ABA.One area that ACT can be helpful within the context of ABA services is through the application of ABA parent training for children with autism spectrum disorder as well as other disabilities. ACT in general can help support all parents through the years of raising children.Although parenting in general can have its difficulties, parent a child with autism seems to have additional challenges as compared to parenting a child with other diagnoses or no diagnoses at all.For instance, parents who have a child with autism often experience more psychosocial difficulties including depression and anxiety, more financial stress, experience an overall more demanding lifestyle, more marital stress, more maladaptive coping strategies, and reduced perception of social support compared to parents of non-ASD kids (Kowalkowski, 2012).One study, completed by Blackledge and Hayes (2005), found that a brief two-day ACT workshop provided to parents of children with autism spectrum disorder was helpful for improving parents symptoms of depression and psychological distress.Two of the core processes of ACT that suggest psychological inflexibility including experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion were also improved in the ACT study (Blackledge & Hayes, 2005).ACT intervention can help parents of children with ASD to improve their quality of life and help them address the challenges that may come with raising a child with autism.Traditional parent training has focused on teaching parents to address current behavioral concerns that their child may be exhibiting.However, it is equally important, if not more important, to approach parent training in a way that helps the parent to have the tools that will help them to manage future behavioral concerns, changes that arise within the family structure, and to navigate family life and their child’s development as time goes on (Kowalkowski, 2012).ACT is an intervention that can help parents gain skills that can help them navigate future experiences.ACT is not only useful for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder, ACT can also be helpful as an intervention strategy to be used when working with parents of youth with ASD.Within the context of ABA parent training services, ACT can be used to increase psychological flexibility which is useful for every human being to develop across their lifetime.ACT can also help parents to be more attentive in the present moment, to be in the here and now through the core process in ACT known as ‘contact with the present moment.’ACT can also be very meaningful for parents in its attempts to help people identify their personal values and then to act in ways that support these values.Overall, ACT can help parents to reduce their stress levels and increase psychological flexibility. ACT can also help reduce symptoms of psychological distress such as depression or anxiety in parents of children with ASD.Parents who receive ACT-based intervention may also experience greater joy in parenting.Consider checking out the ‘One-Year ABA Parent Training Curriculum’ if you’re looking for a structured parent training manual.Blackledge, J.

6 Must - Teach Topics in ABA Parent Training: Be Sure to Cover These Topics in Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Ever wonder what the essential topics are that you should focus on in ABA parent training services?Sometimes, its hard to clarify exactly what it is that we should be teaching since there is, literally, unlimited number of things that we  teach.Let’s take a closer look at what the literature says about what the most important topics are to teach parents when providing ABA-based parent training.There are some common themes across the credible resources available on applied behavior analysis, parent training, and autism spectrum disorder (for those parents who have a child with ASD).One common theme that arises throughout the literature that is important to address in parent training services is the topic of ABCs: Antecedents - Behaviors - Consequences.Understanding the specific antecedents, behaviors, and consequences for a particular child’s behaviors can help a parent to learn “why” their child is doing something which can then help them to figure out what to do to proactively address and reactively respond to their child’s behaviors in order to help their child grow and develop in more productive and appropriate ways (Boone, 2018).To learn more about the parent training topic of ABCs of behavior, get the free parent training lesson on this topic by entering your email below.Enter your email to get the handout and also receive future notifications from us.Your email will not be shared.Thank you! Check your email to confirm your subscription and to get the handout.The lesson plan that you can download above is taken directly from our ‘’ and can be used with parents that you are working with. It includestwo pages of research-supported background information from the literature, one page summary in the format of a easy to read handout, a form that can be used to support provider and parent collaboration, and also a homework assignment activity that parents can use to get more familiar with the topic of ABCs of behavior.Related to parent training topic #1, the second topic recommendation addresses function-based intervention.Function-based intervention helps a parent to implement strategies that truly make a difference in helping their child improve skills and behaviors (Luiselli, 2017).It can be helpful to teach parents how to analyze the ABC data they may collect on their child’s behavior and how to really observe their child’s behaviors in order to identify the function of the identified behavior.Included in function-based intervention, parents should learn about the four functions of behavior:EscapeAttentionAccessAutomaticAfter teaching parents about the functions of behaviors, help them to learn how to identify function-based strategies they can use to help their child reduce maladaptive behaviors and increase adaptive behaviors.Here is a snippet of text from the ‘’ about functions of behavior: The individual behaves in order to get out of or avoid doing something he or she does not want to do.: Escape-maintained behaviors may be due to lack of motivation to perform the task (they don’t want to) or lack of skill (it is too difficult).The individual behaves to get focused attention from parents, teachers, siblings, peers, or other people around them.: Attention doesn’t have to simply be positive attention. Unpleasant examples include the caregiver talking in a stern voice or trying to explain reasons why the child should behave.The individual behaves in a certain way to get a preferred item or participate in an enjoyable activity.NOTE ABOUT ACCESS: Access-maintained behavior may be simply the child gesturing toward something he wants, or it can be more problematic behaviors like whining, throwing, etc.The individual behaves in a specific way because it is reinforcing to them and is not maintained by behaviors from others or outside stimuli. This is sometimes referred to as sensory behaviors.NOTE ABOUT AUTOMATIC REINFORCEMENT: Sometimes behaviors that look like self-harm may have an internal cause (such as medical issues).Although positive reinforcement is a very common and regularly used concept in typical ABA-based direct service intervention, it may not be as common as a topic emphasized in parent training.Positive reinforcement is one of the most effective and most highly recommended strategies for changing behavior and improving skills. This is why it should be emphasized in parent training services. Parents can help their children grow, learn, and succeed through the use of positive reinforcement in their daily lives.Plus, by using positive reinforcement, parents can experience greater personal well-being as well as improve the quality of life and well-being of their family overall. By focusing on what is going right, what their child is doing well, on a regular basis, parenting and life in general can be more enjoyable as compared to focusing on the bad stuff - what the child is doing wrong or what is not going so well.Positive reinforcement can be used to teach countless behaviors and skills and can be used in practically any setting. From teaching a child to tie his shoes to teaching a child to learn to speak in vocal words, sign language, or picture exchange communication, to teaching a child to display appropriate mealtime behaviors and any other skill you can think of, parents can use positive reinforcement in their everyday routines to help their child (Boone, 2018).Enter your email to get a handout and be notified of helpful resources in the future.We won’t share your email.Thank you!

By supporting a child’s life skills or daily living skills, that child can live life with more independence and strength. No matter the developmental level of a child compared to their biological age, life skills are important (Myers, 2010).Jennifer McIlwee Myers, author of “,” makes an excellent point. She says (Myers, 2010, p. 5-6):“The nature of schooling and our society mean that children are often judged and ranked by their academic skills. But there are jobs you can hold if you can’t read. There are jobs you can hold if you can’t write. There are even jobs you can hold if you can’t talk.There are few or no jobs you can keep if you yell or scream when you don’t get what you expected. There are very rarely jobs you can hold if you can’t stop talking when your boss is trying to tell you something. Being on time and being dressed right for that activity are so important to employment that being late to or dressing badly for an interview are job-killers….And even kids who will probably never be independent adults get more respect and more support if they can do the little things… A guy who has occasional meltdowns but mostly understands the idea of doing his fair share and of apologizing for causing others pain or inconvenience is simply more likely to be treated with a modicum of respect and friendliness than one whose behavior constantly triggers defensive responses from those around him.”Enter your email to get the handout and future notifications of helpful resources.Your email will not be shared.Thank you! Check your email to confirm your request for the handout.In addition to teaching parents about basic ABA concepts including those listed above in this article as well as how to individualize it all to their own child, it is also essential to teach parents about generalization and maintenance of behavior and skill development (Kazdin, 2005).Parents have the ability to help ensure that the progress their child makes in therapy, at school, or even at home with the parent is maintained over time and generalized to new settings, to new situations, and with new stimuli (Luiselli, 2017).No one else has as much power as a parent does to help a child maintain progress and expand upon what the child has learned.The below text about generalization is a sample extracted from our ‘:’A behavior has generalized if it has appeared in a wide variety of environments, it has spread to other related behaviors, or it lasts over time. Generalization can be defined as: “the occurrence of relevant behavior under different, non-training conditions (i.e., across subjects, settings, people, behaviors, and/or time) without the scheduling of the same events in those conditions. (Stokes and Baer, 1977 as cited in Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007).include:: Response maintenance refers to whether a behavior continues to be displayed even after treatment or intervention has stopped. The behavior lasts over time.: Setting/situation generalization is when a behavior occurs in settings other than where it was originally taught.: Response generalization is when a learner displays untrained responses that are functionally equivalent to the trained behaviorAlthough the topic of rapport building (or pairing) between parent and child seems to be less often emphasized in the literature within the field of applied behavior analysis, the topic does seem extremely relevant and is often recommended in traditional parent training interventions such as in treatment of children with disruptive behaviors or in the evidence-based intervention known as Parent Child Interaction Therapy.When parents are taught or learn to implement any strategy with the intent to change their child’s behavior in some way, it is very important for them to also focus on developing a healthy relationship with that child - in behavioral terms, the parent should pair themselves with positive reinforcement so that the child will view the parent as a positive reinforcer and be more willing to comply when demands and pressures are placed on them.By associating the parent with the child’s preferred stimuli (activities, toys, etc.), the parent can become a generalized reinforcer for the child. The child then prefers the presence of the parent. He will be more likely to make choices that align with what the parent wants to see.To develop rapport and engage in pairing activities, a parent should spend time with the child and around the child following the child’s lead, showing interest in the child, making no demands, only speaking with declarative language (which serves to share information about your positive observations and feelings such as “This is fun.” or “We’re playing with blocks.”).Although parents can spend set time each day with their child engaging in pairing activities such as by spending 15 minutes of quality time together, pairing should regularly be intertwined with learning opportunities so that the child can easily go back and forth from experiencing the parent in a pairing activity and then within a learning opportunity. It shouldn’t typically be clear to the child that there is a difference between playing and “working” with the parent (Schramm & Miller, 2014).For instance, while playing at the park in a fun way consistent with “pairing,” the parent can insert a learning opportunity by saying “What’s this called?” for a child learning to tact items in the natural environment.This article provided you with an overview of the top 6 recommendations that a service provider should address in parent training services based upon research within relevant literature.As a review, the top 6 parent training topics to address in parent training services include:Antecedents, Behaviors, & Consequences (ABCs)Function-Based InterventionPositive ReinforcementLife SkillsGeneralization & MaintenanceRapport Building (Pairing)Boone, V.

Food Selectivity in Children with Autism - Using ABA Parent Training to Improve Eating Habits,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Picky or selective eating, also known as food selectivity, is a common issue seen in children with autism spectrum disorder. This is a serious issue which could lead to health problems and nutritional deficiencies in these children. Some children may have such severe food selectivity that they may only eat about five different foods. (). It is not clear what causes food selectivity but sensory issues may be one factor.  The aversiveness of the smell, texture, color, or temperature of some foods may contribute to food selectivity, so taking this into consideration with behavioral programming is something to consider. Additionally, consulting with competent professionals and only practicing within your own competence and under training when appropriate is ethical practice which applies to treating food selectivity.Using behavioral skills training is one way to teach parents to work on food selectivity at home outside of treatment. One study by  utilized behavioral skills training to help parents work on taste exposure, escape extinction, and fading for their children who had difficulties with food selectivity. They found that parents improved their performance after the training session and that the intervention resulted in improvements with the children’s acceptance of taking bites of food. Maladaptive behavior reduction also occurred. Even at follow-up, the children from the study maintained increases in the variety of foods they were consuming.  used behavioral skills training (BST) involving instructions,  modeling, rehearsal, and feedback, to train parents to work on food selectivity with their child. The parents were taught to  use extinction and either differential reinforcement of  alternative behavior (DRA) or noncontingent reinforcement (NCR). Results of their study suggest that parents can effectively implement intervention that has been trained by an ABA professional and that positive outcomes can be seen from parent-implemented intervention.To provide ABA parent training for food selectivity in children with autism it is important that the ABA provider have competency in this area in order to provide guidance to the family on feeding-related issues. Per the , BCBAs must only practice in their area of competence and receive proper training for new areas that they would like to become competent in.Parents can be trained to work on food selectivity by first teaching them to complete a taste session as was completed in a study by Sieverling, et. al. (2012). This could include having the caregiver present a single bite of food to their child. After the child ate the bite presented, they were allowed to leave the area for 3 minutes. In the study, The presented bites started out being about the size of a pea and then after the child took the bite of food within 30 seconds of presentation without maladaptive behaviors for three sessions, the size of the bite was increased to half a spoonful. The caregiver tried to work on providing foods from all food groups.Extinction was used in the study if the child spit out the food and a new presentation of the food was presented. Ignoring of maladaptive behavior was used to decrease the problematic behaviors displayed. After ten taste sessions, the caregiver presented 10 minute probe meals with new foods to evaluate generalization of trying new food items.A task analysis to be provided during ABA parent training, particularly for working on food selectivity, can be helpful. When helping a parent learn to utilize a task analysis, using BST is beneficial. The ABA provider can use modeling, rehearsal, and feedback to help a parent learn the steps in the task analysis.To help treat food selectivity in children with autism, using behavioral skills training in ABA Parent Training including use of modeling, rehearsal, and feedback has been demonstrated to have positive outcomes on child eating habits.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Parent-Implemented Intervention - Help Parents Help Their Kids with ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.The National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorder identifies “parent-implemented intervention” as an evidence-based intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder.Parent-implemented intervention is an intervention approach that basically uses behavioral principles to teach parents skills that will help them to encourage skill development and maladaptive behavior reduction in their children.Parents can help their child to experience more learning opportunities than can occur in any treatment setting. This is especially true when treatment options are limited or ABA is less intensive either due to unavailability of the service provider or due to a parent’s preference which could be due to either cost or issues regarding accessing treatment, such as transportation or scheduling concerns.Parent training in ABA may help parents to address the symptoms of autism in their child, maladaptive behaviors being displayed, and/or development of appropriate and functional skills to improve quality of life for their child.Hendricks (2009) reports that parent-implemented intervention has empirical support to help children with autism in the area of communication skills and maladaptive behaviors. Parent-implemented intervention has been found to help kids improve social skills, conversation skills, spontaneous language, using augmentative and alternative communication systems, joint attention skills, and play skills. Research has found that parent-implemented interventions can also help kids with autism become more compliant and improve functional living skills like improving feeding issues. Research supports the use of parent-implemented intervention to help kids with autism who display disruptive or aggressive behaviors, as well.When working with parents, ABA providers should look at the interaction as a partnership or a collaboration. The client benefits when ABA providers include parents in the process of treatment.When the goal of your ABA parent training service is to have the parent implement treatment strategies, also referred to as parent-implemented intervention, there are a few things to keep in mind. To formally complete parent-implemented intervention, there are multiple steps involved.The steps of parent-implemented intervention include:Determine the Needs of the FamilySelecting GoalsDeveloping the Intervention PlanTraining ParentsImplementing the InterventionProgress MonitoringIn applied behavior analysis services, it is important to individualize our intervention. This can be completed through assessment of the child’s skills, observations, and/or interviews. Although there are multiple products out there that offer pre-developed programs and intervention plans, even with these types of products, individualized service is recommended so each client can receive services that are most optimal for them.To determine the needs of the family, ABA providers need to take into consideration the individual circumstances, cultural influences, and resources of each family they work with. ABA parent training does not just involve knowing the child and their skills and areas of need, but quality ABA parent training also includes getting to know the family as a whole and the parents as individuals, as well.There are a variety of ways that you can gain more information about the family. Some ways that ABA providers can explore to help determine the needs of the family include:Formal or informal interviews with parents including addressing:Strengths of the childStrengths of the familyAreas of concern that the parents have regarding their childBehaviors of the child that interfere with the well-being of the familyThe nature of parent-child interactionsExamples of activities that the family participates in (or would like to participate in)Details of the physical layout of the home and other environmental arrangement descriptions (as this may help intervention planning particularly using the antecedent strategy of environmental arrangement)Details about daily routines (or lack of routines)Relationships within the householdRelationships with extended family membersRelationships with friends or peersPotential ideas for supports from family and friends that could help with intervention planningCommunity activities that the family participates in or would like to participate inOther services that the parent and/or child is receiving (to help coordinate services and enhance the benefits of your intervention)Inquire about possible community resources that could help the family (although you could look more into this on your own or with colleagues)Inquire about cultural values, beliefs and expectations that may impact your interactions with the familyObservations of the child in the natural environment (specifically the home setting)Observations of parent-child interactionsWhile ABA professionals are certainly helpful to improve the skills of children with autism spectrum disorder when working directly with the child, parents often have the ability to make an impact on their child’s skills and behaviors through parent training, as well.Parents and ABA providers should collaborate on the development of goals. Although it is necessary that ABA professionals incorporate their training and knowledge into goal selection, partnering with parents on identification of goals is essential for optimal outcomes and for gaining parents’ commitment to the intervention plan (Hendricks, 2009).To select goals for parent-implemented intervention, you should take into consideration the following factors:Does the child already have an existing Individualized Education Plan? If so, consider incorporating the goals on the IEP into your plans for parent-implemented intervention (in ABA parent training).Does the child have an existing treatment plan from another service provider? Is it appropriate to use goals from that treatment plan in your training plans for the parent? For example, is an early childhood specialist working on fine motor skills with the client?Are there health or safety concerns that need to take priority?Does the parent have areas that they would most like to work on first?Will the potential goals have a positive impact on the child and the family?Do the parents have the resources and ability to implement potential intervention strategies?Are the potential goals appropriate for the parents to implement in the home and/or community setting? (Moes & Frea, 2000)FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PARENT-IMPLEMENTED INTERVENTION, SEE OUR NEXT POST..The National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorder reports that “parent-implemented intervention” is an evidence-based intervention for children with autism. Helping parents to learn to implement effective intervention strategies through ABA parent training can be an efficient way to help kids improve skills and reduce maladaptive behaviors. As an ABA provider, you can improve your parent training related skills by learning more about the family and incorporating the parents in goal development and intervention planning.After reviewing some of the recommendations above for working with parents in ABA parent training, specifically in what is called “parent-implemented intervention,” you can implement the following ideas:Look at your current process for gathering information about the family.See if there are topics addressed above that you could incorporate into a parent interview that would help you to improve your ABA parent training services (such as asking about daily routines or support from extended family).When selecting ABA parent training goals, consider the questions listed above? Have you asked the parent for their input on what goals they’d like to be addressed?Plan a meeting to review the client’s goals with the parent to discuss whether your current goals are acceptable by both the ABA provider and the parent and whether new goals should be identified.﻿You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Planned Ignoring: Tips for Recommending Planned Ignoring in ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Simply ignoring a child’s “maladaptive” behaviors is not necessarily always the most effective strategy. However, using a strategy known as planned ignoring can be beneficial in many ways for some situations. When using planned ignoring, it is important that ABA providers are only recommending a parent “ignore” their child’s behavior when the reasoning behind that recommendation is justified. Additionally, the provider should emphasize that it is not about ignoring the child, but instead, the use of planned ignoring is about ignoring the behavior.Planned ignoring is a behavioral intervention strategy that attempts to teach children that maladaptive behaviors are not going to lead to the results that the child is looking for. For instance, if a child is speaking in a rude or inappropriate tone in the home, a parent could ignore this effort to gain the parent’s attention and instead the parent could respond to another child who is speaking more calmly and respectfully. The parent could use differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors to reinforce the child for speaking in a respectful and “inside voice” in the home and use planned ignoring when the child is speaking in a disrespectful or louder tone of voice.Planned ignoring is one way of using the behavioral concept known as extinction. Extinction is when a reinforcer is no longer provided after the behavior of interest. The reinforcer that was previously maintaining the behavior (such as attention) is no longer being provided after the behavior when extinction is being used. Planned ignoring is just one example of how extinction can be used. The intention is that using planned ignoring will lead to the target behavior happening less often or being eliminated (Sheuermann & Hall, 2008; Gable, et. al., 2009).So, in the example of the parent using planned ignoring to address a child’s inappropriate (or disrespectful) way of speaking, planned ignoring attempts to get this child to speak disrespectfully less often. When planned ignoring is used in combination with DRA (differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors), it is more likely that positive outcomes will occur. In the scenario being discussed, using DRA and planned ignoring together is likely to help the child learn to use a more appropriate (more “respectful”) tone of voice. As with any ABA concept, we may need to individualize the strategies being used for each child. For example, some children may benefit from receiving a verbal, visual, or gestural prompt to use their appropriate voice. As an ABA provider, using clinical judgment for what is going to be the most effective for each child is necessary.Providers should always consider the function of the behavior and what replacement behaviors could be taught when recommending strategies for parents to use. Planned ignoring is a strategy that has a specific purpose and designed to achieve specific outcomes.ABA providers should also keep in mind that the Behavior Analyst Certification Board states that we are not to utilize punishment procedures before exhausting the use of positive reinforcement strategies unless necessary for a justifiable reason (such as safety concerns). In the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, the BACB also states that reinforcement of desired alternative behaviors should be incorporated when using any kind of punishment procedure.Although in the common use of the term, “punishment” can be viewed as an undesirable parenting strategy. On the other hand, in ABA, punishment is referring to an intervention strategy of adding or removing something following a behavior that reduces the likelihood of the reoccurrence of that behavior. It is important to remember that punishment procedures, even in ABA, should be carefully approached and that the least restrictive and more positive strategies should be the primary mode of intervention.When using planned ignoring, consider the following aspects of the strategy:Pairing planned ignoring with positive reinforcement strategiesResearch supports the implementation of positive reinforcement for alternative behaviors when you are trying to reduce maladaptive behaviors. Additionally, the BACB instructs behavior analysts to use the combination of reinforcement when using any form of punishment procedure (attempts to reduce the frequency of a behavior).ContingencyUsing planned ignoring should be specific to the target behavior. The parent should ignore the behavior that is identified in the behavior plan. The use of planned ignoring should be contingent upon the behavior. When the child displays the target behavior, the parent implements planned ignoring.ImmediacyThe parent should use planned ignoring immediately upon the child displaying the target behavior. Immediacy is important for both responding to the inappropriate behavior and also for reinforcing the desired alternative behavior.ConsistencyConsistency is important for any behavioral intervention. When using planned ignoring, parents should be committed to the strategy. If they occasionally give attention to the problem behavior, this could result in the child receiving intermittent reinforcement which may make the behavior even more difficult to get rid of. Sometimes parents don’t realize that even their facial expressions or body language provide certain forms of attention or recognition of their child’s behavior. It can be tricky to always be consistent since people’s behavior, even the behavior of parents, tends to be displayed quickly. People usually react “out of habit” or without really thinking about it which can make changing how a parent responds to their child difficult. This is also true for the kids. It can be difficult for kids to change their behavior.SpecificityParents should be specific about the behavior they are targeting. This is true for the maladaptive behavior they are trying to decrease and also for the adaptive behavior they are trying to increase in their child. For the parents’ personal benefit, to make it easier to know what behavior they are supposed to use planned ignoring for and what behavior they should use positive reinforcement for, being specific about the behaviors is helpful. Also, for the benefit of the child, knowing exactly what they are expected to do and what not to do helps the intervention be more effective.Characteristics of the consequencesIt is important to consider the outcome of the use of planned ignoring. Also, being aware of the function of the behavior in the first place will help parents and ABA professionals to know if planned ignoring may be a useful strategy. If the consequence of the behavior happens to be something other than attention from the parent, such as escape from demands or attention from a sibling, then planned ignoring may not be effective. If in fact the function of the behavior is attention from the parent, but the use of planned ignoring doesn’t seem to be working, the ABA provider can help the parent to further investigate any reasons why the strategy may not be effective at that time and see what modifications or recommendations could be made.The effect on the target behaviorInforming parents that the target behavior may increase before it decreases can prevent some frustration from the display of an extinction burst. As an ABA professional, following up with parents on the effect that planned ignoring is having on the target behavior is important to help the parent achieve the best outcomes with this intervention (Hester, et. al., 2009).When using planned ignoring, it may be helpful to explain to the child before you implement the strategy what will be happening. This is especially helpful for kids who are able to comprehend verbal explanations and verbal rules. For a child who has the ability to understand expressive language displayed by someone else, telling them ahead of time that you will not be responding to them when they show inappropriate behavior, can help to reduce the confusion or increased problem behaviors that may occur during the use of the strategy.An example of explaining the use of planned ignoring ahead of time for parents you may work with is the following:A parent has a child who tends to make demands to the parent, such as “Mom, get me a drink!” or “Pack my lunch!” When kids speak in this type of demanding tone rather than in a way that some parents may prefer the child to speak (especially for a child who has the ability to do so), parents may get frustrated. They may feel at a loss for what to do when their child speaks in this disrespectful tone or how to teach the child to be more polite or respectful.When using planned ignoring as a strategy to decrease a child making demands of their parent and to increase more appropriate requests, parents should also incorporate the use of DRA of the appropriate requests. If, in the past, the parent actually did what the child wanted when the child made the “demand”, even if done so unintentionally, the child may have been reinforced for speaking in this way. It is also possible that the child learned to speak this way as a generalization of how they speak to another person or due to this type of speech being modeled by anyone else they had encountered in their environment. The child may have learned to speak in an undesirable tone based on a number of other factors, as well. It is important not to blame a parent but instead to help them work toward a solution.To use planned ignoring, the parent may want to have a discussion with the child ahead of time to tell the child that the parent will no longer be responding to them when they give a demand. Instead, the parent will respond (speak) to the child if they use more respectful requests. The parent should give examples that apply to their child. For instance, the parent could say to their child, “Instead of telling me to get you a drink, you can say ‘Mom, will you get me a drink please?’”At first, the child may, out of habit (or in ABA terms, based upon their learning history and development of behavioral contingencies), give a demand as they typically do. Depending on the child, the parent may need to provide a prompt for the desired appropriate behavior. For example, the parent could slightly nod their head to give the child an indication that the parent is not going to give the child what he or she wants. Also, the parent could simply give a short reminder to verbally prompt the appropriate type of request by saying something like, “Ask, don’t tell.” They could use whatever short phrase that would make sense for their child.Now providing these prompts does somewhat contradict the idea of planned ignoring in that you should not be giving your attention to the child during a planned ignoring implementation. However, when we use our clinical judgement as ABA professionals, we can combine various ABA concepts to lead to the most optimal outcome for each child.Another point to remember is that when using any form of extinction, an extinction burst could occur. This is when the behavior gets worse before it gets better. It is important to inform parents that this may happen but also be sure to prepare them for any safety issues that may occur, such as that a child may begin to get so upset that they throw items across the room or increase their verbal or physical aggression. Safety is always top priority and should be considered.Using planned ignoring as a recommendation in ABA parent training can be useful in that it can provide parents with a tool they can implement to create improvements in their child’s behavior and teach their child new skills (particularly when combined with differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors). However, be mindful that you are following up with parents on how they are implementing planned ignoring and the effectiveness of the strategy. Identify a session date that would be appropriate for you to discuss planned ignoring with the parent you are working with.If possible, demonstrate the use of planned ignoring or role play the idea with the parent.Plan your follow up session to check on how the parent is using the strategy of planned ignoring (and DRA).Provide feedback on the parent’s implementation of planned ignoring and DRA.Follow up with the parent about the child’s progress and maintenance of their use of the strategy of planned ignoring.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

A Bit of Background on Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder has its challenges. For one thing, parenting a child with ASD often comes with more expenses than raising a typically developing child. This may be due to many factors but some of those relate to the various behavioral and physical health challenges that may arise for the child. Generally speaking, although parents certainly love their children deeply, any parent may experience exhaustion from time to time. Parenting a child with ASD may increase feelings of exhaustion in parents as caring for the child with ASD requires ample emotional, physical, and mental resources from the parent (Hayes & Watson, 2013).Behavioral parent training is an intervention that can be beneficial for parents of kids with ASD. Behavioral parent training has significant research support for its effectiveness. Parent training has been used in fields outside of applied behavior analysis for many years. Parent training was developed to help parents address noncompliant and disruptive behaviors in their children (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2007). Parent training could help parents address things like tantrums, aggression, safety issues, inappropriate verbal behavior, social skills, and much more. Parent training doesn’t just have to focus on reducing the occurrence of the disruptive, or “maladaptive” behaviors. Instead, parent training can also emphasize increasing desired, or “adaptive” behaviors.Although parent training can be provided in addition to typical ABA services, parent training may be provided without intensive ABA services, as well. This is especially beneficial for communities in which ABA services are scarce or difficult to obtain.In typical ABA sessions in which a behavior technician is working one on one with a child with autism, the behavior technician is seen as the agent of change. However, in parent training, the parent is viewed as the agent of change. The intent is for the parent to learn strategies that will help change their child’s behavior rather than having to rely on a professional to make the change.In children’s mental health services, parent training has been researched for over 30 years and has been established as an evidence-based treatment. In this area, parent training has focused mostly on externalizing behaviors. Some examples of specific programs that have come out of the children’s mental health field that incorporate parent training include:Parent training in the field of applied behavior analysis has been adapted from the traditional parent training of children’s mental health by utilizing behavioral principles in combination with parent training techniques. To further define parent training in the area of autism spectrum disorder, parent training focuses on helping parents learn ways to reduce the impact of the child’s symptoms of autism on that child’s daily life, to help the child reduce the occurrence of maladaptive behaviors, and also help improve the child’s functional living skills.By using parent training, the child may be able to generalize his skills more than he could if he only had one on one treatment with a clinician. Parents are able to help their child practice and learn new skills in various settings, with various stimuli, and with various people. It’s important for kids to be able to show their skill development outside of the clinician’s office. Having parents involved in treatment and being trained on treatment strategies can help parents help their child to work on and maintain new skills in the home, at the store, at grandma’s house, and more.When providing ABA parent training, consider the following steps:Assess the function of the child’s behavior.Develop realistic goals that are measurable.Teach the parent various behavioral management strategies based upon the function of the behavior.Follow up with the parents to evaluate progress and provide any recommendations for treatment modification if necessary.In the steps of ABA parent training, be sure to include the parent in all steps. Having a collaborative conversation with the parents about each step of the process helps them to feel included in the strategies being developed and also helps to provide learning opportunities for the parents in that you, as the professional, can help the parent to learn more about how you are developing the behavior plan.﻿You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Reinforcement and Punishment - How to Approach These Concepts in ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.As behavior analysts, we understand what the terms “reinforcement” and “punishment” mean in the field of applied behavior analysis. We know that refers to the idea that a behavior increases in frequency after the presentation or removal of a stimulus follows that behavior. Reinforcement can be further defined by whether it is positive or negative reinforcement. is when a stimulus follows a behavior and that behavior increases in frequency of occurrence in the future.  is when a stimulus is removed or avoided following a behavior and that behavior also increases in frequency of occurrence in the future. is basically the opposite of the concept of reinforcement. Punishment, in the field of applied behavior analysis, refers to when a behavior decreases in frequency due to the addition or removal of a stimulus after the behavior. Punishment can also be further defined by whether it is positive or negative punishment. is when a stimulus follows a behavior and that behavior decreases in frequency of occurrence in the future. is when a stimulus is removed after a behavior and the behavior decreases in frequency of occurrence in the future.Reinforcement is not that common of a term in the general population especially when people are talking about behavior and learning. Definitions of “reinforcement” from the Merriam Webster Dictionary include:“the action of strengthening or encouraging somethingthe state of being reinforced”Reinforced means, “to strengthen by additional assistance, material, or supportmake stronger or more pronounced”“something that strengthens or encourages something: such asan addition of troops, supplies, etc., that augments the strength of an army or other military forcesomething designed to provide additional strength (as in a weak area)a response to someone's behavior that is intended to make that person more likely to behave that way againin psychology the action of causing a subject to learn to give or to increase the frequency of a desired response that in classical conditioning involves the repeated presentation of an unconditioned stimulus (such as the sight of food) paired with a conditioned stimulus (such as the sound of a bell) and that in operant conditioning involves the use of a reward following a correct response or a punishment following an incorrect response”Sometimes people think of “reinforcement” as meaning “reward.” In the general population, people may see a reward as an experience that results in a pleasant or positive affective response. In behavioral psychology, reward is sometimes used to explain a stimulus that increases the frequency of a behavior when that stimulus is provided after the identified behavior (White, 2011). When looking at reward in this way, it can be seen as the same thing as reinforcement. But when we are looking at the situation strictly from an ABA perspective, we would describe this definition of reward as being like the use of a positive reinforcer. However, reinforcement may also occur as a result of removal or avoidance of a stimulus (negative reinforcement). In this usage reward is a synonym of reinforcement.Although many fields have their own set of terminology, they use to describe concepts related to their area of specialty, the field of ABA can sometimes create confusion or misunderstanding. This is specifically an issue when we are working with families. The nature of human language development includes the fact that people create meaning from words based on personal experience, connections of the word to various stimuli, and derived arbitrary relations. We can see learn about this concept in more detail when we study  (Gross & Fox, 2009).Even from the field of ABA to other areas of human services, such as child development or pediatric care, we see a difference in how the term “punishment” is used. For example, in the Journal: , an article addresses discipline and punishment. They state, “The word discipline means to impart knowledge and skill – to teach.” They compare the concept of discipline to the concept of punishment. In the context of their description of parenting skills that use discipline, they seem to approach punishment as a harmful concept and an unhelpful parenting strategy. Although their ideas have merit and many other explanations like this in the field of child development and children’s behavioral health have scientific support, ABA professionals must take into consideration the differences in terminology and meanings used from within ABA as compared to outside of ABA.Another academic resource provides a definition of the concept of corporal punishment. They state that, “Corporal punishment is the use of physical force with the intention of causing a child to experience pain, but not injury, for the purpose of correction or control of the child’s behavior. (A report from the advocacy committee, 2003).It is always important to consider how our services comply with the BACB’s code of ethics for behavior analysts. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board provides guidance regarding the use of and recommendation of punishment in ABA services.The Code of Ethic tells us the following in Ethics Item 4.08: Considerations Regarding Punishment Procedures (Professional and Ethical Code, 2014).Recommend reinforcement rather than punishment whenever possible.If reinforcement efforts alone are not effective and punishment procedures are necessary to help the client develop socially significant skills, reinforcement procedures for alternative behaviors must also be included in the treatment.Punishment procedures may only be used without first using reinforcement or thoroughly exploring reinforcement options if the situation involves severe and/or dangerous behaviors which necessitate immediate use of aversive procedures.When using punishment (including aversive procedures), behavior analysts should provide increased support to staff through additional training, supervision, and oversight.Evaluation of any punishment procedures must be evaluated in a timely manner.Modifications to the treatment need to be made if the punishment procedure does not seem to be effective in a reasonable amount of time.When using punishment procedures (or aversive techniques), the behavior analyst also develops a plan to discontinue the use of the procedure and transition back to a focus on using reinforcement.Since we can see that there are differences in the way in which “reinforcement” and “punishment” are defined and used within the field of ABA as compared to outside the field of ABA, we should take this into consideration when speaking with parents in ABA parent training. Be sure to mindful of parents’ personal ideas and opinions of reinforcement and punishment while also providing information to help them understand the terms from an ABA perspective.

Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.(This post may contain affiliate links. We may get a small reimbursement if you purchase the item through our link. We only recommend resources we personally would use and those that we find valuable.)When it comes to parent training in applied behavior analysis services, it can be less than clear what exactly that means. How do you go about providing parent training? Although many ABA educational programs teach an overview of parent training, in practice it can be difficult to know what to actually do in a parent training session and how to make the best use of the often little time you have to work with the parent.In applied behavior analysis parent training, that consist of anything from case coordination and assisting with community referrals and consultations, psychoeducation regarding a variety of topics, helping the parent learn how to help their child develop in the areas of language or social skills, help parents learn techniques that effectively reducing maladaptive behaviors, or review various ABA concepts so the parent can become more familiar with the intervention you are using and how to generalize strategies used in ABA session to the home and community settings (Bearss, et. al., 2015). These are just some examples of what might be provided in a typical applied behavior analysis parent training session.Understanding the nature of the service that you, as the clinician, are planning to provide is beneficial as it will help you to communicate with caregivers, other professionals, funding sources, and staff about what it is that you are providing in your applied behavior analysis parent training sessions (Bearss, et. al., 2015). Also, having a clear idea of what services you are providing will help you improve your confidence and ultimately the quality of your services as you will have a clear direction of where you are going and what you are trying to do.Interestingly, when we consider other fields of human services, particularly services directed toward the functioning of youth, we find that parent training has been used for decades and that it is an evidence-based treatment that has been found to be effective for children with disruptive behaviors.There are many different protocols that may be used with children with disruptive behaviors and some may even be appropriate with some of the kids that you may encounter through your ABA parent training services for children with autism spectrum disorder.Some examples of these parent training protocols supported by research and often used in other behavioral health settings include:Webster Stratton’s Incredible YearsKazdin’s Parent TrainingBarkley’s Defiant ChildrenEyberg’s Parent-Child Interaction Therapy - an evidence-based intervention to treat disruptive behaviors in children ().Although extensive research has been completed on youth with conduct problems and how parent training is effective for this population, less is known about the effectiveness of parent training on youth with autism spectrum disorder and maladaptive behaviors. However, when considering research-supported treatments and knowing your particular client, you may be able to utilize your clinical judgment to select the best parent training curriculum or create an individualized plan for the client you are working with to best suit their needs.Since “the prognosis for children with conduct problems is poor, with outcomes in adulthood including criminal behavior, alcoholism, drug abuse,  domestic violence, child abuse and a range of psychiatric disorders” (). We can assume that some children with autism spectrum disorder who display conduct problems may also experience these poor outcomes without proper intervention. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the service that you are providing and how you are making use of a parent training session to help the child you work with to obtain the best possible outcomes.One in four children with autism spectrum disorder also have clinically significant levels of aggressive behavior, in particular (). Aggressive behavior in children with ASD is the primary behavior that leads to residential placement for these youth. Aggressive behavior is also associated with greater impairments and more intensive medical interventions as compared to those without high levels of aggressive behaviors. With this knowledge, we may consider the evidence for the effectiveness of parent training with a focus on these aggressive behaviors and related conduct problems.As mentioned above, parent training in the field of applied behavior analysis and specifically as it relates to working with individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), does not seem to have a clear, commonly accepted definition. This may be partially due to the complexity and spectrum of issues that arise in this population therefore leading to a highly individualized parent training service or it may be due to the lack of attention to this subject in the research and clinical community.When providing applied behavior analysis parent training when working with youth with autism spectrum disorder, it is important to determine whether you are doing one of two things:PARENT SUPPORT - Are you providing support and guidance and helping parents to learn more about autism, applied behavior analysis, and how it all relates to their child? ORPARENT-MEDIATED INTERVENTION - Are you providing a service which is intended to have the parent actively interact with their child to increase skills and decrease maladaptive behaviors?Maybe you are planning to do some combination of the above two approaches. Regardless of the specific style of your parent training service it is helpful for your clinical work as well as for parents and other professionals involved to understand the purpose and goals of your service ().Further discussion of how to define your ABA parent training service will be provided in future articles on this site.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Talking with Parents About Functions of Behavior in ABA Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.ABA parent training is a complex service, but it is highly valuable and very much needed for many families of children with autism spectrum disorder. As professionals in the applied behavior analysis field, we not only need to use our knowledge and experience of ABA, but we also need to use many skills that help us to work effectively with parents in the context of training and providing guidance and support. We need to be able to incorporate more than just memorized facts about ABA into our interactions with parents in ABA parent training. We should be able to provide a delicate balance of empathy, education, and guidance.Thinking about the purpose of ABA parent training, we know that our main job as ABA service providers is to help parents help their children improve skills and decrease maladaptive behaviors while also helping the parent learn skills themselves that will either directly or indirectly help the identified client. We may also help the family unit as a whole.One area in which we may help parents learn to approach their child’s maladaptive behaviors is by educating them on what the functions of behavior are from an ABA perspective. We should be able to clearly explain the functions of behavior to the parents we are working with yet sometimes we forget that they may come from a different background and likely have not had the same training as us. With that being said, there is nothing wrong or inferior about the knowledge parents have. Certainly, they have insight into their child better than we may even have. However, when it comes to ABA terminology, we should be gentle and compassionate yet appropriately assertive and confident in our ability to help them to learn about the functions of behavior. Ultimately, the ABA professional and the parent are looking out for the best interest of the client. The two individuals should feel as though they are on the same team.So how do we talk about the functions of behavior with parents?We can talk about this topic in our ABA parent training services by explaining that behavior is maintained by its consequences and influenced by its antecedents. We should further clarify that, in ABA – in the way we are discussing behavior, consequences are not really what the general public may think of as consequences. Instead, consequences are the things that happen after the behavior.This also goes for antecedents. Remember to mention that antecedents come before the behavior.Then, you can return to explaining the functions of behavior by pointing out that the consequences of behavior are what tends to make a behavior more or less likely to happen again.Inform parents that there are four functions of behavior; that all behavior happens because of one or more of the four functions of behavior. As a refresher, the four functions of behavior include:Escape or AvoidanceAttentionAccessAutomatic ReinforcementESCAPE OR AVOIDANCEWhen a behavior is maintained by the function of escape or avoidance, the person’s behavior is generally attempting to help them get out of a situation that they do not like or helping them to avoid being in a situation they don’t like.ATTENTIONWhen a behavior is maintained by the function of attention, the person’s behavior is generally attempting to get some form of attention for that individual. Attention can come in various forms. Attention might not always even be “good.” For instance, sometimes kids who continually “talk back” or argue with others may be doing so because the behavior is maintained by the attention received after they “talk back.” This is not to blame either the child or the other person. It is simply an explanation of the behavioral contingencies that tend to occur in human experiences.ACCESSWhen a person’s behavior is maintained by the function of access, this could mean that their behavior serves as a tool to help that individual receive access to any tangible item or experiential activity. Behaviors may lead to the child getting a toy they want or getting to play video games when they want to. Again, talking about the function of behavior isn’t to blame or excuse any behavior. It is simply a way to explain and then a starting point for exploring effective ways to improve a child’s behavior.When looking at the function of access, one child may throw a tantrum in order to access video games whereas another child may complete his homework to play video games. These are just two examples of behavioral contingencies that could happen based on a complex set of factors including a child’s learning history and the parents’ behaviors, as well. Of course, we can look deeper into behavior and provide further rationale for the development of these two situations, but the basic idea is that the function of access has allowed the behavior of tantrums or completing homework to occur in these families.AUTOMATIC REINFORCEMENTSome people might look at automatic reinforcement as being the function that is related to “sensory” experiences. This has some truth to it. Automatically reinforced behaviors are maintained due to the person’s own experiences and not due to what is happening outside his body or based on what other people do in response to his behaviors. An automatically reinforced behavior is maintained based upon a response in the child’s body as experienced through sensory input. This could be that something feels good, that something tastes pleasing or comforting, or that something relieves pain (or attempts to relieve pain).Be sure to review the functions of behavior with parents in ABA parent training. Helping parents understand this idea of behavioral learning can help them to understand your interventions and recommendations more clearly.It is also important to remember that one behavior may have multiple functions depending on the individual child and the context (Day, et. al., 1994). So, although we try to be clear with our terminology, it is not always black and white, which is why parents have you, as the ABA provider, to help guide them through understanding their child’s behavior and helping their child to learn and grow.OTHER POSTS YOU MAY LIKEYou may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

ABA Defined - with a Free ABA Parent Training Handout,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.One of the things that parents of children with autism (especially of kids who are receiving ABA services) need to know is what exactly is ABA. What does ABA mean? How is the service provider “doing ABA”?You can talk to a parent about what applied behavior analysis is by starting with a definition. One definition of ABA is “the science in which tactics derived from the principles of behavior are applied to improve socially significant behavior and experimentation is used to identify the variables responsible for the improvement in behavior (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2014).”CONSIDER PROMOTING YOUR SERVICES IN THE ONLY PLACE ONLINE THAT FOCUSES SOLELY ON HELPING FAMILIES FIND AUTISM SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES! JUST $27 A MONTH!Teaching parents about ABA is important so that the parent is familiar with what the service is that is being provided. In ABA parent training, you could use a structured training program to help parents learn more about ABA. Our ‘’ is an example of a resource you could use. You may also assign parents homework to help them learn to use ABA concepts outside of session.When talking about ABA with parents, it is important to explain the technical language that you use. So, for instance, in the above stated definition of ABA, you would want to break it apart and explain what each part of that definition actually means.To explain the definition of ABA, you could talk more about each of the following parts:What is science?What does it mean by “tactics derived from the principles of behavior”?What is meant by “applied”?What are “socially significant behaviors”?How is “experimentation” used in the child’s ABA services?What “variables” are looked at and evaluated?What exactly does it mean when you talk about “behavior”?For further explanation of these different parts of the definition of ABA, you can get a free handout that can be used either as a guide for further discussion for your own professional reference or it can also be provided to parents as an ABA parent training handout to help them to visualize the concepts that you are talking about.

Research Review of Group Parent Training,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.Parent training is an effective intervention to reduce the professional and financial resources required for the increasing population of children being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Parent training is not always focused on in typical ABA services. However, it is very important to utilize this beneficial intervention. Additionally, group parent training may even make for more efficient intervention training for parents of children with autism. This might also help professionals save time and money by being able to train multiple parents at one time and thus decreasing the amount of one on one time with each parent. Plus, this gives parents opportunities to relate and communicate with one another and share stories and suggestions. One evidence-based strategy for treating children with autism spectrum disorder is pivotal response training or PRT. This is basically an intervention that is based on focusing on pivotal behaviors and teaching in a more natural environment compared to traditional discrete trial training strategies. One study (Minjarez, Williams, & Mercier, 2011) tested the effectiveness of group parent training based on pivotal response training. They looked at how well parents implemented the PRT protocol or the fidelity of the use of the intervention as well as the child's functional verbal utterances or how many appropriate sounds they were making. The findings of the studies show that group parent training in this model was effective at teaching parents about PRT and also increasing their child's language skills.Using group parent training is an effective method and is likely to benefit all parties including the parent, the child, and the service provider.Consider whether funders of your client’s ABA services allow group parent training.Survey your clients’ parents to see if any of them would be interested in a group parent training session.Plan a schedule for parents who want to participate.Plan a session schedule to keep your group structured, informative, and reinforcing for parents (and yourself).You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

ABA Parent Training Topic Idea - Community Signs,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.One of the most important skill areas that an ABA provider (BCBA, BCaBA, teacher, etc.) can utilize as an ABA parent training topic is the area of life skills.Making life skills an important ABA parent training topic is one of the best paths to take in your ABA parent training curriculum.When developing ABA parent training curriculum, consider focusing on helping the child to learn about community signs.IDENTIFICATION OF COMMON COMMUNITY SIGNSIn ABA parent training, ABA providers can help parents to learn effective ABA concepts that are applicable to teaching their children about how to identify signs found in the community. This is essential to help the child learn various safety skills, such as being able to recognize a stop sign, understanding a walk or don’t walk sign, etc.You may consider checking out this product that provides an excellent assortment of community signs and symbols. ABA providers can use these to work with the child during ABA parent training sessions, one-on-one direct ABA, and/or talk with parents about possibly getting these items to use with their child. Parents can oftentimes learn how to implement ABA concepts based upon the service provider modeling the concepts. With that being said, you may want to purchase these cards, model to the parent how to use them, and then the parent can decide if they want to get a set of their own cards to help their child work on the skill outside of session. – National Autism ResourcesClick on the image below to learn more about the community signs product.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

ABA Parent Training Topic Idea - Data Collection,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.ABA (applied behavior analysis) parent training requires extensive knowledge in both the use of ABA concepts and strategies as well as working collaboratively with parents of children with particular needs.Throughout ABA parent training, particularly when working with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder, a behavior analyst needs to develop ABA parent training topics that are relevant to the identified client’s needs (such as his or her diagnosis and symptoms of autism).One topic that could be addressed regarding ASD is the idea of data collection. Data collection is essential to behavior analysis. In applied behavior analysis parent training, data collection is an activity that parents can learn about and even utilize to help their child make progress in learning new skills and decreasing maladaptive behaviors. Data collection can also be used with the child. For example, a child who is working on toilet training could be involved in the data collection so that they can see the progress they are making.Data is objective information that can be used to help make decisions and recommendations for a child’s development and relevant interventions.In ABA, data is used to make decisions regarding the client’s treatment. In ABA parent training, data can be used by the parent to gather data that can be provided to the behavior analyst to help with treatment programming. Data completed by parents can also help the parents as they learn to implement ABA strategies without the direct oversight of the behavior analyst.Data collection is the process of recording information about a particular behavior or skill. There are countless behaviors and skills that can be relevant for data collection. Data can be collected on almost any type of behavior from tooth-brushing skills, tying shoes, doing homework, and other life skills to language skills like learning new words or identifying pronouns, nouns, or verbs…and much more.By keeping data on behaviors, a behavior analyst can see what is working in the treatment or what may need some modifications. Data may also help behavior analysts identify the function of behaviors that may be maintaining maladaptive behaviors.Parents can use data in combination with other ABA strategies to help their child learn new skills and behaviors outside of ABA sessions.Data collection helps behavior analysts to understand behavioral contingencies and to measure how much progress the client is making on their goals. Data gives behavior analysts (and parents) objective information to support decisions about strategies that could be used to help the child achieve their goals. This data helps the behavior analyst to have evidence to support their decisions. Ultimately, data can help support a child improving their quality of life as well as improving and managing their symptoms of their diagnosis.Behavior analysts should consider the needs of each client as well as their caregiver to decide what data would be most beneficial for that family. Sometimes gathering data on the client’s performance on the first trial of the day could be enough to get a reasonable snapshot of the client’s skill development. Other times, it would be more beneficial to gather data on at least 10 or even 20 trials for a client on a target skill (Najdowski, et. al., 2009). There are many different types of data collection in ABA. A behavior analyst will consider what behaviors are being targeted, what the goals are, and what type of data collection is most realistic to achieve the goal of gathering objective and quality data for that child.Behavior analysts can recommend that parents learn about any of the data collection methods if it applies to the child. Some of the different types of data collection include:: How often the behavior happens? Or how often in a given set amount of time?: How long did the behavior happen?: How long did it take for the child to start displaying the target behavior (or skill) after the SD or instruction was given.: Take data at moments in time.: What is the outcome of the behavior?: Antecedent-behavior-consequence data provides information about the possible function and triggers for a behavior. In parent training services, parents can take data on activities they attempt outside of ABA training sessions or on behaviors their child displays. This can help the behavior analyst to provide recommendations more effectively. When requesting that parents provide data, it is important to remember to take into consideration the parent’s other responsibilities and realistic expectations for what data is being requested – the frequency and duration of data collection may impact a parent’s satisfaction with services as well as quality of data being gathered.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

Clearly Define Parent Training - Part 2 - Clean Up Your ABA Parent Training Service Delivery,"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.As mentioned in the last post, Clearly Define Parent Training - Approaches to ABA and Behavioral Health Parent Training, it is important to clarify what you are providing in your parent training services to optimize outcomes for the parent and the client. Although funders may have specific guidelines for parent training (which you should definitely consider), parent training is largely undefined in the field of applied behavior analysis.When working with children with autism spectrum disorder, you may work with a variety of different issues and behaviors. Even within one particular client, it may be challenging to decide which goals to focus on and in what order. This is even more so the case when providing ABA parent training. ABA parent training goals can be difficult to develop in part when you are unsure of exactly the service you are providing when it comes to applied behavior analysis parent training. However, using this site and other research-supported resources, you can identify what your service will entail. Also, remember that all ABA providers have their own style, so it’s okay to have a different style than someone else but focusing on quality and effective treatment of course is a priority.When you are providing parent training services in applied behavior analysis, you should determine if you are providing parent support or parent-mediated intervention (PMI) or some combination of the two service delivery approaches ().Within the service delivery approach of parent support, you might even further define your service as being more focused on care coordination or psychoeducation. Within the service delivery approach of parent-mediated intervention, you might further define your service as being focused on interventions for skill acquisition as it relates to core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder or other presenting concerns or intervention that is focused on reduction of maladaptive behaviors (or likely a combination of these two sub-categories of the PMI approach).See  of the types of service delivery for ABA parent training for children with autism spectrum disorder.After exploring the various service delivery approach that you will take, consider the format of your parent training sessions. Will you be working with the parent one-on-one (just you and the parent), in a group setting (you and more than one parent), or with the parent and child interacting together while you provide education and coaching for the interaction? Some researchers report that parent training when provided in the format of coaching a parent during an interaction with a child may be the most complex (. Other things to consider will be how you provide the information? Are you going to provide self-guided materials? Will you provide teaching on the topic presented in the materials?At what rate will you provide your parent training sessions? Weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly? Quarterly? The intensity of the parent training session may also influence the type of service delivery model that you choose to pursue.You should also consider what would be most appropriate for your client and their family in regards to location of the ABA parent training session. The service could take place in an office, in the client’s home, in a community location, possibly in a school setting, and in any other appropriate location that you and the parent decide upon as well as what would be approved by funders. Applied behavior analysis parent training may also occur via telehealth ().You may also want to consider the duration, or how long the parent will be participating in the training. Is the ABA parent training going to be planned to occur for 3 months? 6 months? one year? or is it an ongoing service? Maybe you will fade the frequency of service after certain objectives are met?Knowing the service delivery approach as well as the format of your sessions will help you to clean up your ABA parent training service delivery because this will help you to have a more defined approach to the service you are providing and will also create a more goal-directed service that is more easily evaluated for continuous improvement and progress evaluation.You may be interested in some of the other resources we have to offer on the topic of ABA parent training.Includes 27 lessons and 148 pages of content including background information on each lesson, parent-provider collaboration worksheets, parent handouts, and parent homework assignments (a PDF download).Get a  or a .A resource for service providers to strengthen their skills and knowledge in the area of parent training.

ABA Parent Training (Tips for Quality Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training),"Welcome to our online space for ABA Parent Training Information and Resources. Find quality, research-supported information from a BCBA on all things Applied Behavior Analysis Parent Training.In applied behavior analysis services, professional ABA providers may not only be working one on one with a client or supervising others who do so. They may also be providing training and consultation to caregivers of those clients. Specifically, this is often referred to as parent training or family guidance.ABA parent training is an important piece of any treatment plan when working with children and adolescents. As caregivers, parents are responsible for helping their child learn and develop by guiding them and teaching them skills and behaviors that will help them in everyday life.It can be a difficult task to come up with ideas for providing high quality ABA parent training curriculum. We will be providing you with research backed information on how to provide the best ABA parent training curriculum for your clients and their caregivers.Parent involvement in the treatment process has been found to be a factor that increases the likelihood of positive outcomes for the child (Crockett and Fleming, 2007). According to Gresham et al. (1999) ABA services for children with autism that include parent training result in greater outcomes for the child as compared to services without ABA parent training incorporated into the treatment.When working with parents, it is important to remember to work together collaboratively rather than in an expert-client dynamic. Parents have knowledge and know the history of their child. This information along with their parental insight combined with the professionals knowledge of effective treatment strategies can be combined in a collaborative manner to individualize the services and create the best chance for optimal outcomes for the child (Albone-Bushnell, 2014).Providing applied behavior analysis parent training to the caregivers of your clients can lead to benefits for the client’s whole family. One option for developing your ABA parent training curriculum is to personalize your services and utilize lesson plans that help you stay focused on the relevant topics of ABA and/or autism spectrum disorder.
