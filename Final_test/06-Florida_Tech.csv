ICYMI: ABA in Dementia Care - 2014 Literature Review,"Approximately five million older Americans are diagnosed with dementia and that number is expected to triple over the next few decades. There is a growing momentum among behavior analysts to practice in the field of dementia care, given that applied behavior analytic procedures have proven to decrease challenging behaviors (e.g., agitation) and increase desirable behaviors (e.g., engagement). It is imperative that clinicians and researchers alike stay current with recent publications in order to provide best practices or ask relevant experimental questions. The purpose of this presentation is to review the five articles published on dementia care in behavior analytic journals. Topics reviewed include challenging behaviors (e.g., hoarding, bizarre speech), verbal behavior and complex learning behaviors. Overall, findings showed that challenging behaviors can be managed via antecedent-manipulations, participants can (re)learn to mand and responding can come under stimulus control. All studies demonstrated the clear advantage of using behavior analytic procedures to manage dementia symptoms.List behavior excesses and deficits in this patient population.Categorize topics published (challenging behavior, verbal behavior, complex learning behavior).Describe the need for research on these topic areas.Outline methods used in recent research publications.Analyze results to determine whether experimental control was demonstrated and whether results answered the experimental question.Interpret result reasoning and formulate further discussion.Identify further research opportunities.Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, nursing home, mand training, challenging behavior, bizarre speech, refusal, hoarding, cooperation, engagement, reinforcement, attention, antecedent/antecedent based interventions, verbal behavior, mandsAppropriate for practitioners who seek to better understand the behavior exhibited by individuals with various types of dementia and behavioral research-based assessment and treatment strategies.: 2 weeks",https://abafit.coursewebs.com/cart/pageCourseInfo.aspx?Course_ID=BEHP1144,https://abafit.coursewebs.com/Courses/BEHP1144/BEHP1144.jpg,$32.50,2.5,Podcast,2

The Wisdom Factor,"Wisdom has been defined in the psychological literature as a trait or, in our behavioral language, the sum of patterns of behaviors and their effects over time that, applied consistently, lead to the label of “wise person” in our society. Based on research by Dr. Paul Baltes and others from the Max Planck Institute in Germany and various other trait/state psychologists, there are clues to what it takes to achieve such a label based on behavioral observation of effect. Behavior analysis knows how to arrange the conditions that surround behavior, leading to such a label being attached to what we say and do. The criteria for such behavioral patterns will be described and a perspective on why it is important for us to consider the implications of producing wisdom in the actions of our children and ourselves will be offered. This presentation will discuss the implications of wisdom and nonwisdom behaviorally on broader issues of culture.Describe the traditional definitions of wisdom.Identify a behavioral definition of wisdom.List the behavioral characteristics of wisdom indicated by Baltes.Analyze how behavior analysis can support the subject matter of wisdom and ethics in our society.Learn how behavioral practitioners can teach wisdom and evaluate being wise.Describe how to build and shape a wiser world.",https://abafit.coursewebs.com/cart/pageCourseInfo.aspx?Course_ID=BEHP1197,https://abafit.coursewebs.com/Courses/BEHP1197/wisdomFactor1.jpg,$19.50,,Podcast,2

Toward a Contingency Analytic Account of Private Experience,"Time:1 hour, 21 minutes1.5 type-2 BACB CEs: $19.50T.V. Joe Layng, Ph.D.Ludwig Wittgenstein, in, wrote:Interlocutor: But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain-behaviour accompanied by pain and pain-behaviour without any pain?Wittgenstein: Admit it? What greater difference could there be?Interlocutor: And yet you again and again reach the conclusion that the sensation itself is a nothing.Wittgenstein: Not at all. It is not a something but it is not a nothing either!How can there be a something about which nothing can be said? And what then differentiates it from a nothing? While this has been a problem for those trying to understand Wittgenstein, it may be the key for a behavior analytic approach to private experience. We make the error Wittgenstein was attempting to warn us about when we try to treat private experience as a something we can directly talk about, e.g., covert stimuli or behavior or consequences. There is no private image we see and respond to, there is no private speech produced and listened to. As Skinner (1963), in, observes, “It took man a long time to understand that when he dreamed of a wolf, no wolf was actually there. It has taken him much longer to understand that not even a representation of a wolf is there.” Yet we have private experience. We can account for private experience not by trying to move the outside inside, overt behavior to covert behavior, but by taking our lead from Skinner (1963) that private experience is part of behavior or, perhaps more precisely, part of a contingency. And we may consider that the concept of behavior be extended to considering that seeing is the behavior of seeing, hearing is the behavior of hearing, and so on for all the senses. And that seeing or hearing in the absence of the thing seen or heard is simply seeing and hearing under the control of stimuli other than that which typically governs what is seen or heard. And much like the location of sweetness is not in the sugar nor in the tongue, but in the relation of the two as function of natural selection, private experience cannot be separated form the contingency from which it is a function and cannot be spoken of directly, but it may perhaps be understood.Objectives:Distinguish between Watsonian, methodological, and radical behaviorism.Describe Skinner’s approach to private experience.Describe the Goldiamond experiments that suggest no image or sensation is actually privately seen or felt.Describe how we learn to talk about our private experience.Distinguish between being a part of behavior (or a contingency) and behavior.Describe how the behavior of driving can occur with no car or road present?Describe the difference between seeing/hearing in the presence of a stimulus and seeing/hearing when the thing seen or heard is absent.Explain why hearing yourself privately speak is not evidence for subvocal speech.Describe the role of SDI guidance in comprehension.Explain how we may account for “free thinking.”Explain the role of the program in investigating thinking.Thinking, Skinner, radical, Watsonian, methodological, private, emotions, thinking, behaviorists, covert stimuli, dimensional and instructional control, private events, SDI, hearing, speaking, contingencyThis course is recommended for BCBAs and BCaBAs with background knowledge of the concepts and principles of behavior analysis.: 2 weeksRefunds are not provided once a course has been accessed.",https://abafit.coursewebs.com/cart/pageCourseInfo.aspx?Course_ID=BEHP1136,https://abafit.coursewebs.com/Courses/BEHP1136/BEHP%201136.jpg,$19.50,,Podcast,
