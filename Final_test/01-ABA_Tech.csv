The Behavior Analyst in Schools,"“One of the hallmarks of applied behavior analysis is relying on experimental methods to help demonstrate function or demonstrate the efficacy of some type of treatment. When you work within schools it’s an incredible challenge to try to be systematic.” —Andrew J. Houvouras on the difficulties of being systematic in school settingsInterdisciplinary teams devise and implement educational plans for children with special learning challenges. Sometimes, these involve a behavior analyst. Whether you are a behavior analyst thinking about working in schools, currently working in schools, or working alongside a school behavior analyst you know schools have teams of several people who contribute to each child’s education plan. Like with any professional, behavior analysts bring their own frameworks and skills to working with teachers and children. Merging that framework with those of other professionals can be difficult. At the end of the day, the entire team must prioritize concerns and coordinate plans and solutions.  In this course, Andrew Houvouras addresses common issues one might encounter in the public school setting—how to ethically resolve those issues and make decisions with the child’s best interest in mind. He also reviews the key factors that impact decisions for more severe cases—how to present data in a digestible format for non-behavior analysts and mediate conversations during interdisciplinary meetings.",https://abatechnologies.com/continuing-education/the-behavior-analyst-in-schools/,https://cdn.abatechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Behavior-Analys-in-Schools-2-768x987.jpg,$39.00,3,Podcast,
"Hearing, Listening and Auditory Imagining","“Sometimes the phenomena of interest are not presently observed and it’s especially true with human behavior. Many people are interested in love, feelings, thinking, perceiving, and remembering, and those are things that are not presently observed. So, the problem that faces us is how do we deal with these phenomena that aren’t presently observed? Well, the philosophical assumptions of our field called radical behaviorism can help.” —Hank Schlinger, PhD on considering private events as important behavior to be observed.Are you a behavior analyst primarily focused on analyzing public events? It’s not uncommon to shy away from the human’s internal world and skip important private events. But, the internal world of hearing, listening, and imagining are just as robust as what is visible to another observer. Hank Schlinger, PhD, proposes a more in-depth look at why you should have more consideration for private events. With the concepts of Skinner’s Verbal Behavior,  Schlinger brings listening as behaving, consciousness as being taught, and imagining as a form of perceptual behavior at the forefront for behavior analysts. His insight on the topic provides the needed perspective to analyze your clients’ behavior and identify its function.",https://abatechnologies.com/continuing-education/hearing-listening-and-auditory-imagining/,https://cdn.abatechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hearing-Listening-and-Auditory-Imagining_1167_vert-768x987.jpg,$32.50,2.5,Podcast,
Mainstream Behavior Analysis,"“The heart of behavior analysis, the heart of the mission  set us on, to bring to the world the notion that the environment plays a tremendous role in the determination of behavior.” “Skinner’s initial vision of behavior analysis was that ‘it would be a generic science that could be harnessed and used to address the concerns of people in everyday life, and concerns of all humankind if they involve behavior’, and clearly that vision has not been realized. It’s my hope that one day it will be.” —Patrick Friman, PhD, ABPP on how far we still have to go with our science and its impact. Practicing behavior analysts are aware of the impact this science and technology have on the welfare and betterment of peoples’ lives.  Whether working with a child with autism or in elderly populations suffering from dementia, behavior analysis can make a difference. Skinner, however, had a much broader vision in mind for what the science could do to address myriad human issues. In this course, Dr. Pat Friman discusses novel applications of behavior analysis, including pediatrics, general childcare, increasing male fertility rate, and environmental sustainability.",https://abatechnologies.com/continuing-education/mainstream-behavior-analysis/,https://cdn.abatechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mainstream-Behavior-Analysis_1042_vert-768x987.jpg,$52.00,4,Podcast,

Getting to Know Children in Foster Care,"“I believe completely that Applied Behavior Analysis is and has been a huge influence in the child welfare arena for many years in the state of Florida. Our positive and productive gains are promising, and we need to compel more behavior analyst clinicians to go out there and replicate this work nationwide.” —Karin Torsiello, MS, BCBAChildren in foster care have had varying life experiences that may impact their behavior. In learning more about their experiential histories, clinicians are better able to pinpoint the contextual variables and functional relations of that child’s environment that have affected their behavior. That information can inform parents who are considering fostering a child. Often, children in the foster care system have experienced numerous caregivers, some adverse experiences, and changing physical environments that impact their development and sense of stability. In this course, Karin Torsiello shares the research on and suggestions for proactive strategies that improve parenting effectiveness and treatment-plan design for children in foster care environments.

Helping Students with ASD Succeed in General Education Classrooms,"“More than 50% of students with  spend at least 2 days per week in regular classrooms. Today, 1 in 3 students with Autism Spectrum Disorder are included in the regular classroom for the entire day.” —William L. Heward, EdD on the need for general education classroom teachers to implement strategies that support their students with autism.General education classrooms are a challenge for even the best of educators. Each student arrives with different strengths and weaknesses from those of their peers. Integrating varied skillsets and behavioral histories under one roof can stall progress. Students with autism also present their own needs, some of which may differ from neurotypical peers. In order for all students to unanimously progress, Dr. Bill Heward presents the key strategies that move entire classrooms forward, and provide the extra bump most ASD learners require. Whether a teacher, behavior analysts, or parent these strategies can support learning and classroom management for classrooms of various sizes.

Interpersonal Skills for the Behavioral Consultant,"“Establish yourself as a conditioned reinforcer. Just be nice, please.” —Stacie Neff, MS, BCBAJoin Stacie Neff, MS, BCBA, on the importance of soft or interpersonal skills that make or break the success of a consultant. Effective consultants can easily initiate meetings, respond professionally during interviews, actively listen during difficult conversations, and react to nonverbal and verbal behavior. Being a pro conversationalist may seem like an art form—you either have it or you don’t. Stacie, however, boils it down to the foundational components that help any professional communicate well with clients, families, and colleagues.",https://abatechnologies.com/continuing-education/interpersonal-skills-for-the-behavioral-consultant/,https://cdn.abatechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Interpersonal-Skills-for-Behavioral-Consultants-2-768x987.jpg,$39.00,3,Podcast,
Why Physical Activity Matters and What to Do about It!,"ABA therapists are no strangers to gummies, M&Ms, or other treats used during long therapy sessions. In a client’s home, many households have stocked cabinets of salty and sweet snacks, while healthier options are tucked in the fridge out of sight, out of mind. The lack of healthy alternatives, along with a reliance on iPads and other technologies as reinforcers during therapy, promote less physical activity and fewer nutritionally healthy options. On any given day, a young client can be at a desk from 1-6 hours with only short spurts of time dedicated to playing. In this course, Nick Green, PhD, health and fitness guru and behavior analyst, reviews the necessity for developing healthy habits in our clients and offers practical tips for making it a larger part of the therapeutic experience.  He outlines key factors that will help case managers incorporate the usual skills taught (i.e. handwashing, changing clothes, direction following) with physical activities. He also presents a definition that behavior analysts should adopt, especially since we are ethically required to provide the greatest outcomes and well-being for our clients.2.

Decreasing Turnover in Human Services,"“Don’t bother doing anything without good performance management procedures in place.” —Byron Wine, PhD, BCBA-D on implementing interventions to address the turnover of direct-care staff.Does turnover impact your organization’s delivery of high-quality care? If so, you are not alone. Turnover plagues most ABA organizations offering services to individuals diagnosed with autism or other developmental delays. Often, organizations see front line employees come and go, which then requires constant recruitment, retraining, and evaluation of service outcomes. All this not to mention the service disruption for most clients.Byron Wine, PhD, has experienced this first hand, both as a leader and researcher who examines the contingencies around turnover and how it impacts organizations and services. In this course, Dr. Wine shows participants, through his personal experience and research, ways to combat turnover.  He delves into the basics of naming types of turnover and calculating its costs and impact while presenting options for addressing the issue.  It probably comes as no surprise, but as Dr. Wine presents—there is no point in any turnover specific interventions until a proper performance management system is in place.",https://abatechnologies.com/continuing-education/decreasing-turnover-in-human-services/,https://cdn.abatechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Decreasing-Turnover-in-HS-tall_v2-768x987.png,$32.50,2.5,Podcast,
