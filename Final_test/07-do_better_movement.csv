NO CEUs - Constant Quest to Do Better,"Behavior analysts work in an ever changing environment where it is crucial to maintain interaction with peers and mentors to provide the most effective access to our science as possible. The purpose of this presentation is to explore a few stories of how specific clients or “problems” have resulted in important personal discoveries within the science of behavior analysis. Broad scale technological advancements are an incredible feat to achieve for our science. However, sometimes the most important accomplishments come from the technologies we develop specific to a certain client or experience that we can then more broadly apply to the work we do as behavior analysts. Most often the problem you seek to solve is vastly different from the actual reason for lack of progress in the first place. Attendees of this presentation should leave with a sense of how to pinpoint the relevant problem and develop solutions for solving it.Learning ObjectivesAttendees will be able to describe how to approach at least 1 barrier to learningAttendees will be able to describe why the analysis in behavior analysis is a crucial component of the work behavior analysts do day in and day out",https://collective.dobettermovement.us/course/free-constant-quest-to-do-better/,https://mk0dobettercolld1ywx.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/dobetteraba_quest-to-do-better_product_8-hour.jpg,0.00,,Podcast,

I will then provide a rationale for how to use story-telling within the current behavior analysis climate and culture, including a brief overview of current conceptual and methodological understandings of the role of narrative in behavior analysis and science at large.

ACT with Families: It is All About Relationships,"As behavior analysts, our jobs are larger than just the client in front of us – they include shaping the behavior of caregivers, siblings, parents, and the whole environment that supports the client’s learning and behavior. Behavior analysts often fail to recognize the significance and power of a strong therapeutic relationship with the entire family. This presentation seeks to introduce Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to behavior analysts as a framework to not only improve behavioral flexibility within the context of their sessions with clients, but also to improve and enhance therapeutic outcomes with parents, families, and within the clinician’s own life. The importance of compassionate care, behavior analytic descriptions of ACT processes, and practical strategies for implementing ACT will be discussed.",https://collective.dobettermovement.us/course/act-with-families-it-is-all-about-relationships/,https://mk0dobettercolld1ywx.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Tommy.jpg,30.00,2.5 ,Podcast,
When Good Ethics Go Bad: Understanding Evidence Based Practice,"Behavior analysts are frequently trained to implement specific procedures found within behavioral and educational journals. However, practitioners frequently encounter situations that do not exactly apply to this literature base. This panel will discuss how to ethically apply the science of behavior analysis using an evidence-based practice model focused on clinical expertise, the individual client, and the best available research. Panelists will discuss how they have successfully applied this model to address common barriers to learning such as weak motivation, escape maintained challenging behavior, prompt dependence, and developing instructional control. Each panelist has significant experience and expertise with applying the science of behavior analysis as a whole and determining the most effective intervention for each client based on the methods and principles of this science as opposed to broadly and generically applying popular procedures with each client. Audience members will be given the opportunity at the end of the panel to ask the panelists for their expertise in ethically addressing common barriers to learning.Participants will be able to identify how at least one section of the Code applies to the use of the evidence-based practice modelParticipants will be able to explain how to modify popular behavior analytic procedures based on the needs of their individual clientsParticipants will be able to explain how to individually assess barriers for each learner and develop interventions based on this assessment.Participants will be able to explain how to synthesize previous research to create effective interventions for clientsParticipants will be able to explain at least 2 drawbacks of solely attending to research when developing intervention",https://collective.dobettermovement.us/course/when-good-ethics-go-bad-understanding-evidence-based-practice/,https://mk0dobettercolld1ywx.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/when-good-ethics-go-bad_product.jpg,45.00,4 ,Podcast,II

How to Teach Motor Coordination and Emotional Regulation Skills,"Activities of daily living, vocational tasks, and leisure skills require a broad use of muscle coordination. Skills ranging from turning a doorknob to playing basketball will be covered. Emotional regulation skills such as mindful breathing and body awareness help learners stay calm and are crucial for social interactions and academic achievement. Together, motor coordination and emotional regulation skills account for the most basic foundation of learning. This session will introduce a practical, hands-on approach to developing muscle coordination (both gross and fine) and emotional regulation programs. Participants will learn the skill sequences for teaching motor movements and emotional regulation for a variety of purposes and with many types of learners.",https://collective.dobettermovement.us/course/how-to-teach-motor-coordination-and-emotional-regulation-skills/,https://mk0dobettercolld1ywx.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/motor-coordination-course.png,40.00,3 ,Podcast,
