Eating and Feeding Problems,"Children with ASD are five times more likely to have feeding problems that include severe tantrums during meals, extreme food selectivity and ritualistic mealtime behaviors (Woodruff Health Science Center, 2013). In this webinar with Dr. Mae Barker Ph.D., BCBA-D, she reviewed ways to assess causes and contributing factors of feeding problems including how to use a food diary and food inventory. Using these assessments, practitioners and parents can determine a baseline and develop a plan to systematically increase appropriate feeding behaviors in the home. Dr. Barker also reviewed practical strategies and tips to address different feeding problems by reviewing four case studies. One such strategy is called The Food Game. The Food Game is a board game that introduces new or challenging foods in a systematic and fun way with little pressure. The use of prizes, modeling and peer interaction makes this approach to introducing new or challenging foods a positive, entertaining experience if done carefully. *Participant complaints regarding this or any other BACB CE event requirements violations must first be directed, in writing, to the Relias Learning ACE Coordinator, Rhonda Davin, PhD.
