Error Correction (ON DEMAND),"The science of teaching has
provided many effective tools. However, even the best planned lesson may not be
effective- there are no perfect lessons. Therefore, students will make errors.
We should aim to minimize the error rate but we should also have systematic
plans in place when errors occur. We will briefly review some of the current
literature regarding error correction (EC), which points to the importance of
stimulus control and differential reinforcement. We will then discuss four
specific types of EC and related them to specific types of lessons. First, we
will consider one strategy for errors within discrete trial types of lessons.
Then we will review two types of EC within sequential lessons. Finally, we will
review potential strategies when shaping is our primary teaching strategy. With
these strategies associated with specific lesson types, we should never be
surprised when the next error occurs and should always have a reactive plan.    ",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/andy-bondy-error-correction-webinar-ondemand,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Bondy.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Autism Spectrum Disorders: Supporting Individuals with Sexuality Education (On Demand),"Dr. Matt Tincani is back to talk sexuality and ASD once again! With updated information on research and practices.The presentation will overview sexuality needs of youth and adults with ASD as a context for discussing best practices in sexuality education. First, sexuality-related characteristics of individuals with ASD will be described, including skill deficits and potential goal areas for sexuality education programs. Next, promising and empirically supported sexuality education programs will be discussed with a focus on person-centered planning, promoting sexual health, and preventing abuse, STIs, and early pregnancy.

Cultural Humility - Equity & Diversity in ABA (On Demand),"Applied behavior analysis (ABA) has the intent to improve the human condition in a broad range of categories of practice and for diverse groups of individuals across cultures. Paradoxically, the unique culture of behavior analysis creates barriers to achieving this desired outcome. The data on the lack of diversity of the professionals practicing in the field of behavior analysis is emerging. There is a growing call to action to address equity and diversity in the field. In addition to the professionals working in the field of ABA, access to ABA intervention is also fraught with inequities; poverty, race and ethnicity, geography and other variables all create access barriers.  Cultural humility is a framework to address both institutional and individual behavior that contribute to the power imbalance, the marginalization of communities and disparities in health care access and health outcomes. This session will discuss the framework of cultural humility and how the individual and institutional practices might be incorporated into the work of ABA. Through improved cultural humility improved outcomes can be realized by the field and those for whom we provide service.

Equity of Autism Services in Rural America: A BCBA Supervisor Call to Action (On Demand),"Autism in rural America has not been widely studied. We know that fewer children in rural America are receiving autism diagnoses, are diagnosed at a much later age then their suburban and urban peers, and many do not receive autism intervention at the intensity rate needed to change the trajectory of the disorder. Research findings suggest that variables contributing to poor outcomes for people with ASD include both intrinsic factors (severity of symptoms, cognitive ability, co-morbid mental health issues) and extrinsic factors (socioeconomic status, access to services, coordinated services, and transition services). Applied behavior analysis has the strongest evidence base as an effective autism treatment. Yet, in many rural areas across the United States, there are no or few BCBAs to provide services. This session explores the lack of BCBAs in rural areas that clearly impact access to evidence-based services for children with ASD, presents research findings from one project that explored the process and impact of upskilling in a rural community of poverty following the BACB supervision guidelines, and presents a call to action of BCBAs to provide supervision for professionals working to become BCBAs, BCaBAs and RBTs.

A Behavioral Approach to ADHD and Anxiety,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder of childhood that often persists into adulthood. It is reported that more than 1 in 10 (11%) of US, school-aged children have received an ADHD diagnosis by a health care provider (CDC, 2016). While medications are often prescribed for children with ADHD or anxiety, the first line of treatment recommended by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is behavioral therapy. This recommendation is also supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and is further supported by research published in the Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology (Pelham et al., 2016).During this webinar we:",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu?product_id=223,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/bu_presenters/ak.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Momentary Prompting and Modeling of Behavior-Based Labor Strategies (ON DEMAND),"The Cesarean Epidemic is
categorized by the increasing cesarean section rate
in the U.S., currently 30.8% (Boyle et al., 2013), which is in stark contrast
to the 5% cesarean rate during the early 1970’s (Goer & Romano, 2012). The
“cascade of interventions” resulting from an otherwise healthy women utilizing
non-medically-necessary but often routine pain medications during labor contribute
to the U.S.’s poor outcomes in maternal and infant health.  A troubling statistic released by the United
Nations in September of 2010 placed the U.S. 50 in the world for
maternal mortality, higher than almost all European countries (WHO, 2010; Coeytaux,
Bingham & Langer, 2011). In a report summarizing the World Health
Organization’s principles of perinatal care, appropriate methods for pain
relief are all suggested to be behavioral (Chalmers, Mangiaterra & Porter,
2001). However, skills learned during childbirth education are difficult to
generalize and the
unavailability of ongoing labor support are major contributing factors in high
requests for pain medication (Goer & Ramano, 2012).  This talk addresses these concerns using a

Bogus! Detecting and Avoiding Unproven and Pseudoscientific Interventions (ON DEMAND),"Behavior analysts have an ethical obligation to provide students/clients with the most effective interventions available, but the helping professions are flooded with unproven, controversial, and pseudoscientific therapies and treatments. This presents challenges to behavior analysts serving families and/or collaborating with other professionals who request various unsupported or invalidated treatments. This webinar will provide behavior analysts with tools and skills to evaluate claims, distinguish between science and pseudoscience, and adhere to an evidence-based approach to serving students/clients when questionable practices are selected by other stakeholders. Presenter Bio:Jason Travers is an assistant professor in the special education department at Kansas University. Jason earned his doctorate at University of Nevada Las Vegas and is a former public school special educator for learners with autism.

A Behavioral Systems Approach to Ethics Training and Supervision (On-Demand),"Professional and ethical behaviors are critical for high quality care and consumer protection. By using behavioral systems, behavior analysts may increase the probability of employees engaging in professional and ethical behaviors because systems may describe ""what to do"" instead of ""what not to do"" when faced with a professional or ethical issue. This presentation will discuss examples of behavioral systems that accomplish this goal. Specifically, it will discuss systems designed to teach and maintain professional and ethical behavior in an organization, build and maintain relationships in interdisciplinary settings, and define scope of competency. These examples will serve as a starting point for how professionals may integrate customized systems into their own organization.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/Matthew-Brodhead-ethics-training-supervision-webinar-ondemand,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/bu_presenters/broadhead.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Consulting in Schools: BCBAs in Education,"Sometimes being a BCBA in a school setting can feel like you're a square peg in a round hole. There are so many opportunities and so many challenges at the same time. This webinar is designed for BCBAs who work in or consult with public schools but who may not have a background in school law, particularly laws related to special education. Dr. Amanda DiGangi has worked with public and private schools for many years and has had tremendous success building collaborative relationships between ABA providers and schools. The foundations of ABA serve as a guide and support for this success. This session will provide a background on the two main legislative laws related to students with disabilities in public and private schools: IDEA and 504, their basic mandates, as well as the similarities and differences between them. In particular,  participants will examine how consulting in schools is affected by the BACB Professional and Ethical Compliance Code. It  possible for BCBAs to work successfully and ethically within the education system and to be key members of the team providing Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to students. The 7 components of ABA laid out by Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968) can help us achieve this.

AAC strategies for individuals with autism: A contrarian’s perspective (Sept),"This talk begins with a review of functional communication, including long term goals, from a behavioral perspective. Key issues will include speaker vs. listener distinctions, functional units and factors related to expanding communication repertoires. The next section reviews speech generating devices (SGDs), their popularity, and concerns such as distinguishing between ‘toy use’ vs. ‘communication device’ and the role of the audio output. Next, factors related to demonstrations that a user ‘knows’ the meaning of words in different modalities will be reviewed. Then follows a review of research related to both SGD and picture use by individuals with ASD regarding functional communication. This section will include examples of studies that appear to over-estimate functional relations and the paucity of research demonstrating a robust gain in repertoire sizes. Lastly, some suggestions will be provided associated with determining how we can assure that our efforts to teach functional communication results in effective outcomes.Learners will define the broad goals of teaching functional communication skills.Learners will identify key elements to assure that an SGD is used as a communications device.Learners will describe the relationship between ‘knowing’ and discrimination skills.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/bondy-lectures-aac-ondemand,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Bondy.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Making Grassroots Efforts Work: Ethics of Effective Advocacy (ON DEMAND),"As behavior analysts we believe behavior change can be achieved, whether that is organizational, individual, or systemic change we are talking about.

Ethical Issues in Standardizing Professional Decision-making,"Recent scholarship in applied behavior analysis has focused on the conceptual development of decision-making algorithms (DMA) to assist professionals in making practice-related decisions. A DMA is typically portrayed as a decision tree or flow-chart. By answering a series of questions, the user is guided through the DMA towards a specific answer. Though a DMA may allow for standardization of employee decision-making, the ethical issues and limitations surrounding their use requires discussion. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss outcomes from a series of studies that have evaluated DMAs in the context of visual analysis in order to highlight some of the ethical issues and limitations associated with their use in practice.Learning objectives:Participants will identify examples of decision-making algorithms in behavior-analytic research.Participants will identify ethical-issues associated with the development of decision-making algorithms.Participants will identify ethical-issues associated with the use of decision-making algorithms in behavior-analytic practice.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/brodhead-lectures-decision-making-on-demand,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/bu_presenters/broadhead.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,

"Ethics in Providing ABA for Sexuality Education: Considering Culture, Family Values, and the BACB Ethical Code of Conduct (ON DEMAND)","Sexuality education for people with autism-spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities is a topic frequently overlooked by intervention teams. Sexuality education is a sensitive topic that many do not feel comfortable addressing with families and clients. Sexual behaviors are learned and can be taught. Behavior analysts are in the unique position to help families and people with disabilities proactively learn appropriate behavior that allows them to be self determined in sexuality at their greatest potential. This session will provide a rationale for BCBAs to teach sexuality education, and provide a guideline on how to plan for sexuality education while considering culture and family, scope of practice, medical clearance, national standards, ABA curriculum, and referrals to other professionals.

The Role of Kindness in Applied Behavior Analysis (ON DEMAND),"The Role of Kindness in Applied Behavior AnalysisBehavioral principles of learning and motivation are powerful concepts that have produced powerful technologies for behavior change. However, the tremendous effectiveness of ABA principles does not necessarily guarantee that they will be implemented in a caring manner. Many other helping professions emphasize the role of empathy and compassion in treatment delivery but they are rarely emphasized in behavior analytic training. Skinner viewed the purpose of the science of behavior to influence society to be based more on positive reinforcement and less on aversive control, leading to a more peaceful and caring world. This presentation will tie together contributions from Skinner’s work, the BACB ethical guidelines, and behavior analytic research on increasing happiness in individuals with developmental disabilities, with the goal of discussing potential future directions for research and practice in ABA that aims to increase kindness and compassion throughout the ABA assessment, treatment, parent training, and staff management process.

Ethical Issues around the Use of Restraints and Seclusion in Schools (ON DEMAND),"Government reports and popular media stories indicate widespread misuse of restraint/seclusion of students with autism and other developmental disabilities. Several reasons may explain the overreliance on these methods. First, many schools inadvertently use restraint/seclusion as behavior management interventions. Research literature in the behavioral sciences indicates that repeated use of restraint/seclusion may inadvertently reinforce severe behavior dependent upon the function of the behavior. In this way, it is clear that these methods should not be used as intervention procedures, but only be applied when the student's behavior reaches crisis levels. Second, an instance of restraint/seclusion should signal to intervention team members that other highly specialized interventions and supports are needed. However, many schools may not have proper behavior support plans in place that teach and reinforce new skills/behaviors to replace problem behaviors that lead to restraint/seclusion.The use of restraint/seclusion in the public school system has gained more attention as families, advocates, and the federal government have taken action to guide and monitor the use of these methods in public schools. Legal precedent for the use of restraint/seclusion in the public schools has been established (McAfee, Schwilk, & Mitruski, 2006). The use of restraint/seclusion to keep a child and others safe is not prohibited by law, or under the same constitutional restrictions as institutions. Indeed, school personnel are expected to keep children safe and may need to use restraint to do so. School personnel are subject to criminal and civil liability if restraints are misused. The purpose of this paper is to present issues related to the use of restraint and seclusion in the schools, provide an overview of the data on the use of restraint and seclusion in schools, discuss state polices on restraint and seclusion discuss the literature to support the use of ABA to reduce the use of restraint and seclusions, review the BACB/CEC Guidelines as supports for BCBAs and provide guiding questions that IEP teams can use to assess their use of restraints/seclusion procedures.Ethical Issues around the Use of Restraints and Seclusion in SchoolsDuration: 102 minutesBio:Peggy Schaefer Whitby is an associate professor at the University of Arkansas and serves as the program coordinator for special education.

So Many Problems and I can Solve Every Single One (On Demand),"We frequently encounter problems for which we have no immediately available solution that will allow us to contact reinforcement or escape from an aversive situation. When this happens, we problem solve by prompting and probing our own behavior such that a solution to the problem becomes more likely. We have learned to problem solve by talking to ourselves, talking to others, looking around our environments, searching for answers online, posting questions in online forums, watching YouTube videos, using applications on our phones, and even re-arranging furniture. So much of our daily activity requires problem solving that we often take our ability to problem solve for granted. We might not even think about all the times during the day that we encounter problems that need to be solved because our problem-solving behavior has become so fluent. Problem solving is a learned behavior. Some people learn it incidentally, but others might require more explicit instruction. In this presentation I will define problem solving from a behavior analytic perspective, identify examples of problem solving that are common to everyday events, discuss problem-solving research, make some recommendations for future problem-solving research, and also share some suggestions for teaching problem solving in clinical practice.Learning Objectives",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu?product_id=249,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/kisamore_manufact.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
So Much More Than Paperwork: Infusing Cultural Humility into your Supervision,"Within the life of an ABA professional few things are universal. With different educational backgrounds, areas of professional interest and geographical location, no two ABA professionals possess identical learning histories. The purpose of the supervision experience should be to train future generations of behavior analysts to engage in high quality service delivery; however, for far too long some have implemented a one-size fits all approach. Individualized interventions are the cornerstone of our science; so why is this same approach not taken within the supervision experience? Supervision (absent cultural humility) cannot prepare the next generation of behavior analysts to face the growing needs of service recipients. The infusion of culturally humility into the supervision experience will benefit the field of ABA for generations to come.

Getting It Right: Understanding and Adjusting Intervention Intensity for Learners with Autism,"Behavior analysts are keenly aware that intensive intervention is critical for attaining better outcomes for their clients with autism. While many may only use hours of treatment per week as their indicators of treatment intensity, this is not a technically accurate measure and does not offer clinicians much practical value. Through broader understanding of the aspects of treatment intensity, professionals can more accurately determine when to abandon an ineffective intervention and make more nuanced decisions about a potentially effective intervention. This webinar will introduce different and more valuable concepts of intervention intensity. Specific information about how intensity can be measured and manipulated as part of a treatment plan will be described. Recommendations for considering treatment intensity for data-based decision-making also will be covered along with practical examples that illustrate how to adjust the intensity of evidence-based practices for learners with autism.

Family Centered Positive Behavior Support with Families of Children with Autism and Developmental Disabilities (ON DEMAND),"This interactive webinar will introduce
participants to a family centered, positive behavior support (FC-PBS) approach
to addressing problem behavior in children with autism and developmental
disabilities in collaboration with family members in family settings in the
home and community. Powerpoint-based information and instructor-led activities will
introduce participants to key features of the FC-PBS approach, including the
development of a collaborative partnership with family members, the conduct of
a comprehensive assessment that includes a functional assessment and family
ecology assessment, and the design of a technically sound and contextually
appropriate behavior support plan based on assessment results. Selected
readings and a bibliography of research on PBS with families will offer
evidence of the scientific-basis for the approach. A tool kit of assessment
forms, blank competing behavior pathways diagrams, PBS plan design rubric, and
behavior support planning checklist will be made available to webinar
participants.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/lucyshyn-family-centered-behavior-strategies,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Joe Lucyshyn.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
A Call for Discussion about Scope of Competence in Behavior Analysis (ON DEMAND),Scope of competence refers to activities that the individual practitioner can perform at a certain criterion level. This webinar will stimulate a discussion about how behavior analysts self-evaluate their own scope of competence. This presentation will include discussion on how practitioners might expand their scope of competence if the needs of consumers require practitioners to expand into new areas. ,,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu?product_id=154,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/bu_presenters/broadhead.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Recent Applications in Stimulus Equivalence-Based Instruction and Practice Tips (ON DEMAND),"Stimulus Equivalence-Based Instruction was first introduced and used by Murray Sidman (1971) to teach reading comprehension to a young man with microcephaly and intellectual disability. Since then, equivalence-based instruction has been applied to many teaching situations and contexts from teaching math (Fisher, 2005), geography (LeBlanc, Miguel, Cummings, Goldsmith, & Carr, 2003), statistics (Critchfield & Fineup, 2010), art history (Aguayo & Garcia, 2005), second languages (Ramirez & Rehfeldt, 2009), etc. This presentation will review a variety of recent application of equivalence-based instructions from the research literature, as well as offer new and innovative uses for this technology. In addition, tips will be suggested for using this technology in practice.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/fisher-stimulus-equivalence-webinar,"https://behavioruniversity.com/image/

Using Technology to Enhance Effective and Efficient Supervision for BACB Supervisees (ON DEMAND),"The purpose of the BACB supervision experience is to improve behavior analytic, professional, and ethical repertoires of the supervisee, and monitor supervisee’s performance in the field. As with everything in behavior analysis, there should be a clear course of study, supervisees’ behavior should be operationally defined with objective and measurable goals to determine the application of their skills, and they should receive sage guidance from an experienced expert who is able to enhance their professional development.A growing body of published literature is forming a research basis to inform supervisors on how, when, and why to use technology-based supervision and training.  In order to meet the ever-increasing need for clinical supervision services, supervisors are turning towards technology as a mechanism for supervision. The use of technology provides opportunities to implement evidence-based supervision, evaluate staff competencies, and provide feedback to shape effective interactions between supervisees and clients. A review of an empirically based approach to clinical supervision of BACB supervisees will be presented. In addition, implications and suggestions for future research in this area will be discussed.At the end of the presentation, participants will:",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/lika-technology-enhance-efficient-supervision,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Jamie_Hughes_Lika.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Teaching Social Skills to Adolescents and Young Adults,"Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder often have difficulty developing friendships and intimate relationships. There are limited data describing optimal social skills to guide clinical practice. The purpose of this talk is to describe assessment and interventions for conversational skill deficits. Conversations are requisite to more advanced social skills. I will discuss how to identify conversation skills in need of intervention and how to design relevant teaching contexts. I will review findings from my lab’s recent research on teaching conversation skills.Learning objectives: At the conclusion of the presentation, participants will be able to:",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/hood-lectures-social-skills-adolescents-on-demand,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Stephanie_Hood.jpg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
When Practice Informs Research: The Road to Teaching Complex Verbal Discriminations,"To acquire functional language, children with autism need to be able to respond to complex verbal discriminations. However, there is relatively little research to guide the process of teaching such skills. The purpose of this talk is to explore considerations that should be taken into account when teaching multiply controlled verbal behavior such as intraverbal tacts. We will do so in the context of a practice-driven research question, challenges that arose when teaching these skills, and the inevitable research questions that followed.Instructional level of presentation: Intermediate",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu?product_id=219,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/Nicole.png,$39.00,2,Podcast,
Leveraging Social Media: Ethical Considerations & Suggested Practices (ON DEMAND),"In this presentation I will make the case that social media is to be
leveraged to further the behavior analytic vision. Whether your team
provides services to children on the spectrum, organizational behavior
management, industry-specific consultation, or is entrepreneurial in
nature the argument will be presented that a well-designed and
executed social media presence can strengthen a brand and create
opportunities for businesses and social movements that our foremothers
and forefathers dreamt of. A review of the relevant literature within
behavior analysis and relevant work outside behavioral science will be
reviewed along with current best-practices, ethical considerations,
and starting points for creating relevant content and showing the
world the power of behavior analysis.",,,Behavior-University,https://behavioruniversity.com/bcba-ceu/odonnell-leveraging-social-media-webinar-aba,https://behavioruniversity.com/image/catalog/RyanO.jpeg,$39.00,2,Podcast,
