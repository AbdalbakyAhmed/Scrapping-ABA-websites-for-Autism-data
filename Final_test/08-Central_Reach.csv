Pinpoint Guidelines,"Pinpoint Guidelines is a supplemental course in the CR Institute pinpointing course series. This course is designed to give clear guidelines to help learners pinpoint more effectively. A majority of the guidelines were created based on common errors made in the pinpointing process by previous learners. Since this course is based on the experiences of the co-instructors, a majority of this course is a conversational format where the co-instructors discuss common errors made by beginner pinpointers and potential solutions. This course is recommended for learners who have already learned the basics of pinpointing through a live workshop or prerequisite course, such as Pinpoint+ Mechanics. At this stage, learners can begin to create pinpoints for clients or students; this course is ideal for checking one’s work and making slight modifications to ensure pinpoints created will lead to meaningful data insights on a standard celeration chart..

Precision Teaching and Instructional Design: Component-Composite Analysis ,"Join hosts Rick Kubina, Ph.d., BCBA-D, Amy Evans, M.ED., BCBA and co-host Dr. Kent Johnson, Ph.d., Founder and Director of Morningside Academy for an educational 60 minute webinar about Component-Composite analysis.

Component-composite analysis is vital to the success of Precision Teaching. These procedures break down higher level, real world, composite performances into their components and tool skills, which guide the teacher to the appropriate place to begin instruction: with the learner’s entering behavior. When instruction begins at the learner’s entering behavior level, their escape and avoidance behaviors and the need for behavior reduction procedures are minimized. Many examples will be provided of component-composite analysis, and identify key areas for completing component-composite analyses in reading, writing and math.

"Building Bridges with ""Old-Schoolers"" ","Task List elements G06 and K08 emphasize the importance of establishing working relationships with non-behaviorist team members when serving clients as a behavior analyst. In practice, this is sometimes the most difficult component of the job, as we receive a great deal of instruction in the science of behavior analysis, but very little instruction in the science of persuading people who are simply not persuaded by science. In this presentation, we will focus on shifting the conversation from one of process to one of outcome. Attendees will review research findings on some popularly held beliefs such as “spare the rod, spoil the child,” and “in my day, we didn’t have problems like this.” We will then discuss ways to introduce these counter-arguments into the conversation, as well as ways to disrupt the conversation entirely with summary statements. negotiation approaches, and (you guessed it) positive reinforcement.

Behavior Analysis Within The Context of Person-Centered Planning ,"Person-centered planning (PCP) has become a staple of service delivery systems for people with developmental disabilities. Research on PCP has been equivocal at best, although outcome failures are generally attributed to implementation failures. The science of behavior analysis provides many solutions to the problems described in the PCP literature. Additionally, behavior analysts must be prepared to adjust to working in a team-based system that is based largely on humanistic, rather than scientific, foundations. This event will provide information regarding the philosophical basis of PCP, common practices, triumphs and limitations, as well as ways the behavior analyst might be able to help the process. We will also discuss ways the work of the behavior analyst might be impacted by this team approach.

Using Behavior Analytic Methods to Assess for Environmental Deficits in Residential Services ,"Behavior Analysts frequently are asked to assess the behaviors of persons living, working, or learning in settings that elicit the very behaviors they seek to eliminate. Traditional functional assessment processes that focus on the individual do shed light on some of those problems. However, organizations frequently deal with such findings by ignoring system-challenging information or by making narrow adjustments that serve only the identified individual (although others are likely affected). Behavior Analysis has tools that can capture systematic problems with environmental quality. Although adding this information into an FBA is more costly and time-consuming, it can be particularly helpful for situations in which extreme behaviors have not remitted with traditional methods, or in settings in which consumer behaviors as a whole tend to worsen after admission. In this course, we will focus specifically on the environmental deficits of residential care that are frequently associated with challenging behavior of people with severe developmental disabilities. However, the techniques described could be tailored for home, work, and educational environments as well.

Advanced Functional Communication Training- Up your FCT Game,"Considering that Functional Communication Training is one of the most commonly implemented interventions to reduce problem behavior and increase appropriate function-related communication, knowing the basics is not enough. It is critical that FCT interventions include components that address increasing the complexity/level of the functional communication response (FCR), develop FCRs that are robust and persistent, and ultimately advance the intervention such that it can easily be supported in the natural environment by readily available behavior change agents. This workshop focuses on advanced components of FCT, including strategies to advance the FCR, methods to teach the individual to accept and tolerate delays and denials, and procedures that support schedule thinning to levels appropriate for the individual’s natural environment and contexts.

FBA research in this area is lacking significantly (Hustyi et al., 2012, Larson et al, 2014, Larson et al., 2013) and behaviorists need to address a deficit in physical activity using the same process for any problem behavior. Furthermore, in this module, the learner can expect to acquire information about various types of physical activity; how to select an appropriate type of physical activity for a client; common competing behaviors, punishers, and Sdeltas for physical activity; and how to select appropriate intervention strategies to increase physical activity that are acceptable to the client and are more likely to lead to long-term behavior change. This module focuses on how to analyze a deficit in physical activity and does not, specifically, teach a behaviorist how to address a deficit in physical activity for a specific population. Therefore, learners will need to generalize and adapt information to fully meet their client’s goals.

Getting started with Precision Teaching for Applied Behavior Analysis ,"Getting Started with Precision Teaching will teach you how to apply Precision Teaching to all your learners or clients. As a practicing behavior analyst or teacher applying behavior change principles, you will learn practical day-to-day methods that will facilitate the following skills:

Pinpointing behavior (takes the place of long, wordy operational definitions)
Recording behavior with frequency (using standard, absolute, universal measures for sensitive behavior measurement)
Standard Celeration Charting (applying the most precise visual tool for monitoring, analyzing, and communicating behavioral change data)
Enhanced problem solving (using systematic methods to advance behavioral progress and continually determine the effectiveness of interventions)

Supercharging Our Autism Intervention Program with Precision Teaching,"Want to supercharge your autism intervention program? Then hear from staff at Shining Through Centre, who will share how they implemented Precision Teaching to accelerate superior outcomes.

Starting in October 2016, Shining Through Centre decided to use Chartlytics Precision Teaching. Since then, their behavioral intervention programs have gained much value from transitioning to the Standard Celeration Chart and Chartlytics.

Clinical Director Shiri Bartman will discuss both the hiccups and growing pains of changing to the new data platform, plus the tremendous benefits. With the incredible support from the Chartlytics team, Shining Through was able to train all staff not only to use the system but to become more effective teachers and better analysts. Now, staff are all utilizing data more frequently in the decision making process and seeing more active and effective intervention from the front line staff. They are also talking much more precisely about behavior and program targets. Shifting to Chartlytics was exactly what Shining Through needed to take autism programming to the next level of integrity, quality, and efficiency.

Functional Curriculum Design for Language-Cognitive Habilitation ,"This presentation is to acquaint practitioners who utilize EIBI curricula such as PEAK, the Verbal Behavior Curriculum (VBC), or the Competent Learner Model (CLM) with important curricular design principles. These principals underlie the sequencing, threading, measurement and modification decisions that allow one to individualize and optimize language/cognitive habilitative programs. Following a brief review of the history of curriculum design the presentation will cover modern, behavior analytic design principles and technologies that provide a basis for a functional analysis of curriculum and which drive the production of generative learning outcomes. The presentation will also cover contributions to curricular design and outcome measurement from both Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and Precision Teaching (PT) perspectives. 1 Type II BACB CEU.

Integrating Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) into Behavior Analytic Service Models,"Behavioral repertoires that are free from the influence of problematic, rule-governed behavior can give way to behavior that is value-driven and focused on the present moment. Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) is a contemporary behavioral approach that focuses on several core processes involved in producing psychological flexibility and valued living. This session will show how ACT components focused on values, committed action, defusion and mindfulness can be implemented with consumers in behavior analytic service models. 

The examples provided represent brief and low effort iterations of these techniques, showing that positive impacts may be measured despite lower dosages and intensities of these practices. We will share how behavioral measures can be employed to evaluate the effects of these practices on socially relevant behavior, and how protocols employing direct contingency management can be bolstered by adding features of ACT. 1 Type II BACB CEU.

Learning Pictures: Helping Precision Teachers Make Quality Decisions Quickly ,"What makes Precision Teaching and the Standard Celeration Chart (SCC) so special? They allow you to analyze and quickly make decisions with the data you collect. You could collect a mountain of data, but without quality analysis, it is often useless. At Haugland Learning Center, students with ASD and staff use ""learning pictures"" to analyze data and make decisions about what to do next.

This webinar will discuss how to simplify data analysis and decision making with SCC data. It will show how learning pictures, along with some other simple techniques, can make decisions easy for even the newest SCC users.

Precision Teaching: A Two-Factored Powerhouse ,"There are two features that differentiate Precision Teaching from the rest of the ABA community: the Standard Celeration Chart (SCC) and free-operant-based curriculum.  When these critical features are used in combination with each other, learners make significant gains, learning is maximized, and individualism is championed. The brilliant brains at Chartlytics have taken care of disseminating factor one.  And even after users have seen the value and need of using the SCC, some face a barrier of actually putting the sensitive measurement tool to use.  They still have a Discrete Trial Training or traditional educational view and struggle with seeing how to “free-up” the academic skill or program. 

Dr. Kerri Milyko will talk about the “component-composite view” of how to transform or initially generate curriculum suited to Precision Teaching methods and measurement.  Attendees will see video clips ranging from children with developmental disabilities to those who are typically functioning, ages 3 to 12, with examples from Precision TLC’s curriculum.

What is this controversial thing that I'm going to talk to you about today? It's graphing. 

 But before I get into that, let's talk about visual analysis. Visual analysis, this comes from. They say that visual analysis is 1) the extent in type of variability and data, 2) the level of data, and 3) trends of data. If you do the visual analysis, you must do these three things.""

 Realizing the Unique Benefits and Specific Challenges of Group Supervision ,"Abstract: Effective supervision practices directly impact the professional development of the supervisee. Supervisors likely provide individual supervision to their supervisees. However, supervisors may also elect to provide supervision in a group format. Group supervision provides the supervisor and supervisees with unique opportunities to develop important repertoires in the areas of interpersonal communication and professionalism, as well as behavior analytic content. However, the quality of the supervisees’ outcomes and experiences is directly impacted by the supervisor’s skills related to arranging the critical relevant components of the experience. Proper management of those variables allows all parties to maximize the effectiveness of the unique benefits and learning opportunities available in a group setting. This workshop focuses on identifying those critical supervision characteristics related to the success of the group experience, and suggesting specific actions that supervisors can take to optimize the group learning experience. Learning Objectives 1. Identify specific benefits of group supervision 2. Identify specific strategies for maximizing the benefits of group supervision.

Detecting and Addressing Issues in the Supervisory Relationships, Because Not Only Cars Break Down ,"GUEST PRESENTER: Dr. Tyra Sellers, BCBA-D.   Behavior analysts who provide supervision to staff are responsible for providing effective experiences that include teaching basic behavior analytic skills (e.g., verbal repertoires, technical repertoires, clinical decision-making) and developing the supervisee’s interpersonal skills and professionalism repertoires. It is possible that difficulties will arise in the supervisory relationship, affecting the relationship and related activities in a negative way. These difficulties may be related to a wide variety of supervisor or supervisee barriers and deficits. In this workshop we review the need for supervisors to continually and thoughtfully reflect on their own history, repertoires, and behavior to facilitate continued professional development. We will also discuss specific actions that the supervisor can take to continually assess for and detect developing issues, and subsequently address barriers to successful supervision related to a damaged supervisory relationship and persistent interpersonal and professional skills of the supervisee.  1 Type II BACB Supervision CEU.

Supervisee Ethical Dilemmas and Resolutions ,"The BACB’s Professional and Ethical Compliance Code provides guidance to behavior analysts in ten categories ranging from personal conduct to professional behavior, and encompassing supervisory relationships, relationships with non-behaviorally trained team members, and business practices. However, the power differential between supervisors and supervisees complicate its application when the supervisee is concerned about the actions of the supervisor. This course will provide a behavior analytic framework to assist the supervisee in defining the problem, identifying multiple possible solutions, and selecting a resolution action. Tips for preparing for confrontation are provided as well.
