Sal Ruiz – A Precision Approach to Independent Field Experience,"1.0 Type II CE Credits/ 1.0 Supervision CreditAbout the presentation:Precision Teaching is a highly effective system to help those achieve fluent behavior. Currently the Behavior Analyst Certification Board requires those pursuing BCBA/BCaBA certification to obtain 1000-15– hours of field experience, 5% of which must be in direct contact with a BCBA that provides supervision. Chartlytics/Central Reach provides an online distance Supervision program that uses Precision Teaching to make effective decisions about Trainee progress and teaches those pursuing certification how to make decision using SCC. The results has been a group of newly minted Behavior Analysts confident and capable at using PT with their learners. Discussion points will include where the program goes next and ways to improve existing Independent Field Experiences for those pursuing certification.",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/sal-ruiz-a-precision-approach-to-independent-field-experience/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,

"Rob Holdsambeck- Challenges of Supervision: lazy rats, shopping math, and the internet","After a time, many clinicians are asked to move from providing direct services into a role of providing supervision to others. This can present some unique challenges. Behavioral scientists preach that data is are critical to managing effective programs. One of the key challenges for supervisors is getting real data. Lazy rats, shopping math, and the internet are all stories that show how this search for insight can go wrong. In this talk, Dr. Holdsambeck will use some of the lessons he learned from his early graduate training in behavioral science, through working with couples as a psychologist in private practice, to his current role running an agency and working with others at the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.Upon Completion of this presentation, participants will be able to: ",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/rob-holdsambeck-challenges-of-supervision-lazy-rats-shopping-math-and-the-internet/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast, 
Rob Holdsambeck – Supervision: Flying Over Kansas Thinking About Oz,"The movie version of Frank Baum’s classic 1900’s children’s novel (The Wizard of Oz, Warner Brothers, 1939) has been analyzed for decades from various angles.  There are archetypes like Glenda the good witch and Toto the trickster, yellow brick roads (i.e., golden path that lead to hopes and dreams), a false wizard, and a long treatise on courage, intelligence, and heart. In the end, the journey showed how weathering storms and pursuing dreams can produce positive outcomes. This is of course unless the flying monkeys and fields of poppies get you first. The journey of supervision can be viewed as a parallel experience to those that Dorothy and her peers experienced in The Wizard of Oz. Providing a structure for leadership and supervision in the fields of clinical psychology and applied behavior analysis can be a challenge.  It takes weathering adversity, surrounding yourself with the right friends, following the right path, and valuing diversity.  In this talk I will cover some strategies for providing supervision in challenging environments both in my current practice of ABA and my past work as a clinical psychologist.",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/rob-holdsambeck-supervision-flying-over-kansas-thinking-about-oz-quiz-evaluation/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,

Scott Geller – Improving Well-Being and Life Satisfaction with Humanistic Behaviorism,"The term “humanistic behaviorism” was popular in the 1970’s, but has rarely been used since. However, B.F. Skinner affirmed in 1978 that “ makes it possible to achieve the goals of  more effectively.” Relatedly, the presenter has combined fundamentals of behaviorism (e.g., positive reinforcement, observational learning, and behavior-based feedback) with select principles from humanism (e.g., empathy, self-determination theory, and Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs) to enhance and sustain positive relations between teachers and students, parents and children, work supervisors and employees, and between police officers and the citizens they serve. The presenter claims that effective leaders practice humanistic behaviorism, in contrast to managers who essentially hold people accountable with extrinsic contingencies. This presentation will review the presenter’s attempts to improve human welfare on a large scale—first with applied behavioral science, and subsequently with humanistic behaviorism—leading to his belief that “ makes it possible to achieve the goals of  more effectively.” Domains of application to be highlighted from the presenter’s 50 years of intervention development and evaluation include: environmental preservation, prison management for death-row inmates, vehicle safety and road rage, occupational health and safety, and the cultivation of an actively-caring-for-people (AC4P) culture in educational facilities, organizations, and the community at large (see  and ) ",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/scott-geller-improving-well-being-and-life-satisfaction-with-humanistic-behaviorism/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,

Tara A. Fahmie- Functional Strategies for Preventing the Development of Severe Problem Behavior,"Research on the functional analysis of severe behavior (aggression, self-injury, property destruction) has yielded a great deal of information about the conditions that give rise to and maintain such behavior in individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. These collective findings have produced a powerful technology for behavior change; however, the prevailing focus of behavior analytic services remains on the treatment of existing severe behavior. In this presentation, I will propose several strategies to prevent the initial onset of severe problem behavior. Strategies will be based on a review of emerging areas of research in both the functional analysis of severe behavior and prevention.Upon completion of this presentation, participants will be able to: ",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/tara-a-fahmie-functional-strategies-for-preventing-the-development-of-severe-problem-behavior/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast, 
Andy Lattal – The History of Behavioral Apparatus,"The Cambridge Center is pleased to present this third installment in our Continuing Education (CE/CEU) series, a fascinating look at the way operant research labs have used and evolved technology in the development of our science of Behavior Analysis. Andy Lattal presented this to the Cambridge Center at our annual Trustees meeting in 2006, and he consented to present it in front of our cameras in San Diego on May 29, 2007, the closing day of the ABA conference. Andy makes some very good points about the interaction of our instrumentation and our conceptual understanding of behavior. We measure only what our apparatus allows us to, and in the beginning it required an inventor’s skill set to be to present stimuli and measure behavior while manipulating contingencies of reinforcement. The advancement of instrumentation and apparatus has led to more sophisticated questions about behavior as it has become possible to measure it. The evolution of behavioral technology both enables and reflects our scientific interests. ",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/andy-lattal-the-history-of-behavioral-apparatus/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,40.00, ,Podcast, 
Dr. Jay Moore – Conceptual Issues in a Science of Behavior from Watson to Skinner,"John B. Watson was born in rural South Carolina in 1878. He held faculty positions at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins, delivered his behaviorist manifesto at Columbia University in 1913, carried out a controversial fear conditioning project with Little Albert B. in 1919-1920, but was obliged to resign from academia in 1920, owing to personal circumstances. He then became a successful executive in the advertising business. He was married twice, the first ending in divorce and the second with the death of his wife, Rosalie, in 1936. He died in 1958. B. F. Skinner never met Watson, although Skinner read many of Watsons books and Watson influenced the development of Skinners behaviorism in many ways. One important difference between the two is that Watson recognized only control by antecedents, whereas Skinner recognized selection by consequences. Two common statements about Watsons behaviorism are that it subscribed to methodological behaviorism and an extreme environmentalism. This presentation suggests that Watsons behaviorism is more accurately described as espousing an anti-mentalism and a social activism.",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/dr-jay-moore-conceptual-issues-in-a-science-of-behavior-from-watson-to-skinner/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,

"Donald A. Hantula, Ph.D. : Introduction to Behavioral Economics (2007)","The second release in our Continuing Education (CE/CEU) program, this talk was originally filmed on May 29, 2007 in San Diego on the last day of the ABAI convention.The Cambridge Center is fortunate in having more than one leader in behavioral economics among its Trustees: Steve Hursh and Donald Hantula. Several years ago, Dr. Hursh addressed the annual CCBS Trustees meeting, and presented “Behavioral Economics and the Future of Behavior Analysis.” We later posted the Powerpoint slides from that presentation here on behavior.org as a resource, and they consistently rank high in popularity year after year. Many of us first heard the term “behavioral economics” by reading Hursh’s papers in .In 2004, the Cambridge Center and Temple University jointly hosted “” Don Hantula was the conference organizer and a presenter, as were Steve Hursh, George Ainslie, Mark Dixon, and many others, talking about how a behavioral economist looks at problems like consumer behavior, gambling, and drug abuse.At our Annual Meeting in 2006, Don agreed to make this presentation before our cameras in San Diego. You’ll find his presentation informative, to the point, and well-explained for the behavior analyst. Hantula talked about the origins of behavioral economics and the distinctions between that viewpoint and traditional economics. He discussed the economics of behavioral situations, and explained the differences between open and closed economies. Next, he talked about models of choice in behavioral vs. traditional economics, and related it to work by Herrnstein and many others on the Matching Law. Finally, he discussed delayed discounting and hyperbolic curves, and why that explained some things that otherwise wouldn’t make sense.When asked how behavioral economics was relevant to the ABA practitioner, Don answered “Are your reinforcers not reinforcing? Are you seeing problem behaviors going on in your classrooms that you can’t figure out how to address? Are you seeing people making choices that you cannot understand? Behavioral economics will provide a way to make sense of this, and also provide a way to analyze a situation and develop new and innovative interventions to change the behaviors of interest and improve the lives of the people with whom you are working.”",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/donald-a-hantula-ph-d-introduction-to-behavioral-economics-2007/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,50.00, ,Podcast,

A large number of supplemental and or competing therapies exist, some of which have empirical support while many others do not.This presentation is designed to comprehensively review the philosophical underpinning, assessment methods, instructional goals and specific instructional practices involved in the implementation of EIBI and DIR/Floortime. This review suggests that a number of specific practices of DIR/Floortime are in direct contradiction to and may undermine the effectiveness of behavior analytically based interventions used in EIBI services. Video exemplars will be use to illustrate these differences. The ethical issues associated with combining these two approaches will also be discussed.At the end of this 50-minute workshop, participants will be able to:",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/robert-k-ross-aba-and-dir-floortime-compatible-or-incompatible/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,18.00,II,Podcast,1.0

Raymond Miltenberger – For Safety’s Sake,"In cooperation with Karen R. Wagner, PhD and Behavior Services of Brevard, we offer the following CEU opportunity from The (R)Evolution of Behavior Analysis project:Dr Raymond Miltenberger: For Safety’s SakeRaymond Miltenberger has taken safety training to a whole new level. While at Western Michigan, Dr. Miltenberger was heavily influenced by several professors such as Al Poling and Jack Michael, but it was Wayne Fugua who developed his interest in habit reversal, and Cheryl Poche who initiated a long line of research in safety skills training for children. A post-doc at a prestigious research hospital in Maryland allowed him opportunities to learn and collaborate with such notables as Terry Page, Gary Pace and Brian Iwata, and prepared him to work with significantly behaviorally-challenged individuals. Although he has worked with this difficult population, he continued to focus on the behavior of more typically-developing populations, and their potentially dangerous behaviors. Ranging from gun safety to abduction prevention, Dr. Miltenberger has amassed a large body of research that has identified some critical areas of focus, particularly when teaching life-saving safety skills. Hear how a shocking outcome to an early research project challenged Dr. Miltenberger to re-think what he thought he knew, and observe as he explains how he gained hard won knowledge in behavior change procedures that can have a significant impact on the general population.

Jonathan Tarbox – Practicing Acceptance and Commitment Training inside Behavior Analysis: Foundations and Latest Developments,"B.F. Skinner always envisioned behavior analysis as a comprehensive science of all human behavior, including private events. In recent decades, behavior analysts have begun to address the complex overt and covert behaviors of typically developing adults as derived relational responding and have developed procedures for producing substantial changes in socially meaningful overt behaviors, via intervening on the clients’ verbal repertoires that interact with such overt behaviors in complex ways. Most of this work has been done under the umbrella of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The goal of interventions based on ACT is to disrupt control of maladaptive behaviors by rigid and ineffective rules, particularly rules that describe short-term negative reinforcement contingencies and reorient behavior to be controlled to a greater degree by rules describing longer-term positive reinforcement contingencies. Although ACT was originally developed as a behavior analytic approach to treating traditional psychological disorders, it is based on a behavior analytic interpretation of the role of complex verbal behavior in overt behavior change and is therefore equally applicable to bringing about valued behavior change in any behavioral situation in which a person’s verbal behavior might be relevant to their overt behavior change. This presentation will provide a behavioral conceptual analysis of ACT procedures in terms of behavioral functional relations, will present recent data on the use of ACT inside of ABA, and will discuss issues related to scope of practice.At the conclusion of the presentation, the participants will be able to:1. Identify what ACT is and how it can be applied to behavior analysis.

E. Scott Geller – Caring About Social Significance,"In cooperation with Karen R. Wagner, PhD and Behavior Services of Brevard, we offer the following CEU opportunity from The (R)Evolution of Behavior Analysis project:Dr E. Scott Geller: Caring About Social SignificanceScott Geller is arguably one of the most prolific researchers in the field of behavior analysis. He has large bodies of research in increasing seatbelt use, increasing APPROPRIATE student drinking behavior, increasing the use of trash receptacles, increasing safe work behavior, and increasing beneficial interpersonal interactions with a group of behaviors he calls Actively Caring. With hundreds of publications, including numerous books and monographs, Dr Geller has the data to back his hypotheses of human behavior.Trained as a Cognitive Psychologist, his leanings towards applied behavioral applications were reinforced early on by his wanderings into the labs of Dr Nate Azrin and Dr Ted Ayllon while in graduate school at Southern Illinois University. After achieving tenure at Virginia Tech in the early 70s as a cognitive psychologist with an incredible 60 publications under his belt, Dr Geller felt he wasnt making enough of a difference in the lives of people, and started dabbling in changing group behavior. Finding success by increasing recycling on campus, he quickly expanded into other research involving changing behaviors to increase socially meaningful behaviors with the general population. Soon he was successfully publishing in behavior analytic publications and presenting at behavior analysis conferences. Organizational behavior management has never been the same, and cognitive psychology’s loss is certainly behavior analysis gain. Please join the (R)Evolution of Behavior Analysis in examining the life and work of Dr. E. Scott Geller.1.

Alexandra Protopopova – Behavioral Population-Level Interventions at the Animal Shelter,"With 10% of the dog population of the US currently housed in animal shelters, finding interventions to increase adoption rates has the potential to improve the quality of life for a large number of animals. As a first step in addressing the goal of systematically developing behavioral interventions to improve adoption rates, we assessed which morphological and behavioral characteristics predict adoption in shelter dogs. Using a large-scale observational design in dogs housed at a county shelter, we found that dogs that leaned or rubbed their body on the kennel, engaged in excessive locomotion, or faced away from the front of the kennel took a prolonged time to be adopted. Furthermore, we found that lying down next to and not ignoring play invitations from the potential adopter increased likelihood of adoption. These results were the first of their kind in providing data that suggested which behaviors to target when designing interventions. We then developed cost-effective interventions that improved the behavior of dogs both in and out of the kennel. We demonstrated that a simple Pavlovian pairing procedure is equivalent in efficacy to a more difficult-to-administer operant procedure in decreasing undesirable in-kennel behavior of shelter dogs. We also experimentally demonstrated an increase in adoptions when targeting relevant out-of-kennel behavior. Our results have provided shelters with empirically validated and efficient training procedures to reduce undesirable behaviors of shelter dogs and improve adoption rates.",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/alexandra-protopopova-behavioral-population-level-interventions-at-the-animal-shelter/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,

Judah Axe – Improving Social Skills by Teaching Problem Solving,"Title: “Improving Social Skills by Teaching Problem Solving”
Abstract:
Children with autism struggle with social skills. The social world is full of “problems,” defined
as situations in which a response is in the child’s repertoire but is not immediately evoked. For
example, a child may be able to initiate conversations, but in a crowded social situation, it is
difficult to know when to do so. Problem solving is arranging stimuli to increase the probability
of arriving at a solution. This might involve looking at each group of people and deciding if it is
an appropriate time to start a conversation. Talking about the past also presents problems and
problem solving as people often have to “think back” to what happened to arrive at a response.
We also solve many of our problems by “Googling it.” The presenter will describe these
phenomena and share studies on teaching problem solving to students with autism to improve
how they talk about past events and answer social questions about planning a trip, such as “how
far” and “what’s the weather?”",https://uwf.behavior.org/product/judah-axe-improving-social-skills-by-teaching-problem-solving/,https://uwf.behavior.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cambridge-center-behavioral-studies-header-desktop-logo.png,12.00, ,Podcast,
