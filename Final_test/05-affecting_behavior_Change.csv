Evaluating the Efficacy of the PEAK Relational Training System Using a Randomized Controlled Trial of Children with Autism,"Abstract: The present investigation sought to examine the efficacy of the instructional curriculum described in the Direct Training Module of the PEAK Relational Training System on the language repertoires, as measured by the PEAK direct assessment, of children diagnosed with autism or related developmental disabilities. Twenty-seven children diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorders were evaluated using the PEAK direct training assessment protocol prior to assignment to control and experimental groups. Participants in the experimental group received additional language instruction derived from the curriculum programs of the Direct Training Module, while participants in the control group received treatment as usual. Both groups were then re-assessed using the PEAK direct assessment after 1 month. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that participants in the experimental group made significantly more gains in language skills than those who were assigned to the control group, F(1, 22) = 9.684, p = .005. Implications for evidence-based practice and future research are discussed.1 Type 2 BACB CE.Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

"Functional Assessment of Problem Behavior: Dispelling Myths, Overcoming Implementation Obstacles, and Developing New Lore","The Professional and Ethical Compliance Code states that “Behavior analysts conduct current assessments prior to making recommendations or developing behavior-change programs. The type of assessment used is determined by client’s needs and consent, environmental parameters, and other contextual variables. When behavior analysts are developing a behavior-reduction program, they must first conduct a functional assessment.” (3.01 a) and “If environmental conditions hinder implementation of the behavior-change program, behavior analysts seek to eliminate the environmental constraints, or identify in writing the obstacles to doing so.”  (4.07 b).  BCBA's practical application of ABA can be confounded by time and money.  Hanley's  2012 article, Functional Assessment of Problem Behavior: Dispelling Myths, Overcoming Implementation Obstacles, and Developing New Lore,  describes the basic tenets of the interview-informed synthesized contingencies assessment.  Reading the 18 page article and answering 16 questions with 100% accuracy will give the analyst insight into new techniques for overcoming these obstacles and implementing functional analyses.1.5 Type 2 CEs-BACB ACE providerChristen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

Expanding the Consumer Base for Behavior-Analytic Services: Meeting the Needs of Consumers in the 21st Century,"Abstract: A growing workforce of behavior analysts provides services to individuals with autism and intellectual disabilities as legislative initiatives have spurred a growth of funding options to support these services.  Though many opportunities currently exist for serving individuals with autism, the growing demand for these services may wane or, at some point, the growth in service providers will meet that demand.  Other consumer groups could benefit from behavior analytic services, but typically have limited access to qualified providers.  Individuals with dementia and traumatic brain injury are used as example consumer groups to illustrate the necessary tasks for a behavior analyst to expand their scope of practice to a new population. This paper provides strategies for developing competence and creating employment opportunities with new consumer groups.Read LeBlanc et al. 10-page article and answer 10 questions with 100% accuracy to receive 1 Type 2 CEBACB ACE providerChristen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

Predictors of Access to Sex Education for Children With Intellectual Disabilities in Public Schools,"Abstract: Data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study—2 (SRI International, 2002) were analyzed to identify variables that predicted whether individuals with intellectual disability (ID) received sex education in public schools across the United States. Results suggested that individuals receiving special education services without ID were only slightly more likely to receive sex education than students with mild ID (47.5% and 44.1%, respectively), but the percentage of students with moderate to profound ID that received sex education was significantly lower (16.18%). Analysis of teacher opinions and perceptions of the likelihood of the students benefiting from sex education found that most teachers indicated that students without ID or with mild ID would benefit (60% and 68%, respectively), but the percentage dropped to 25% for students with moderate to profound ID. Finally, across all students, the only significant demographic variable that predicted receipt ofsex education was more expressive communication skills. Results are discussed in terms of ensuring equal access to sex education for students with ID in public schools.Read Barnard-Brak et al., 2014 12-page article and answer 10 questions with 100% accuracy to receive 1 Type 2 CEBACB ACE providerChristen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

COMPONENT ANALYSES USING SINGLE-SUBJECT EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: A REVIEW,"Abstract: A component analysis is a systematic assessment of 2 or more independent variables or components that comprise a treatment package. Component analyses are important for the analysis of behavior; however, previous research provides only cursory descriptions of the topic. Therefore, in this review the definition of component analysis is discussed, and a notation system for evaluating the experimental designs of component analyses is described. Thirty articles that included a component analysis were identified via a literature search. The majority of the studies successfully identified a necessary component; however, most of these studies did not evaluate the sufficiency of the necessary component. The notation system may be helpful in developing experimental designs that best suit the purpose of studies aimed at conducting component analyses of treatment packages. Read Ward-Horner and Sturmey's 2010 article, complete the quiz to 100% and complete the evaluation form to receive 2 Type 2 BACB CEs,Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

A New Frontier: Integrating Behavioral and Digital Technology to Promote Health Behavior,"Course completion includes reading the Dallery et al., 2014 article and completing the quiz to 100% accuracy.Abstract: Modifiable behavioral risk factors such as cigarette smoking, physical inactivity,and obesity contribute to over 40% of premature deaths in the USA. Advances in digital and information technology are creating unprecedented opportunities for behavior analysts to assess and modify these risk factors. Technological advances include mobile devices, wearable sensors, biomarker detectors, and real-time access to therapeutic support via information technology. Integrating these advances with behavioral technology in the form of conceptually systematic principles and procedures could usher in a new generation of effective and scalable behavioral interventions targeting health behavior. In this selective review of the literature, we discuss how technological tools can assess and modify a range of antecedents and consequences of healthy and unhealthy behavior. We also describe practical, methodological, and conceptual advantages for behavior analysts that stem from the use of technology to assess and treat health behavior.Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

Trial-Based Functional Analysis,"Course completion includes reading Lambert et al., 2012 and Bloom et al., 2011 articles and completing the CE quiz to 100% accuracy.Abstracts (respectively):Problem behavior is common in early childhood special education classrooms. Functional communication training (FCT; Carr & Durand, 1985) may reduce problem behavior but requires identification of its function. The trial-based functional analysis (FA) is a method that can be used to identify problem behavior function in schools. We conducted trial-based FAs and FCT with 3 children in an early childhood special education setting. All trial-based FAs resulted in identification of behavioral functions, and subsequent FCT led to reductions in problem behavior and increases in communication. We evaluated a trial-based approach to conducting functional analyses in classroom settings. Ten students referred for problem behavior were exposed to a series of assessment trials, which were interspersed among classroom activities throughout the day. Results of these trial-based functional analyses were compared to those of more traditional functional analyses. Outcomes of both assessments showed correspondence in 6 of the 10 cases and partial correspondence in a 7th case. Results of the standard functional analysis suggested reasons for obtained differences in 2 cases of noncorrespondence, which were verified when portions of the trial-based functional analyses were modified and repeated. These results indicate that a trial-based functional analysis may be a viable assessment method when resources needed to conduct a standard functional analysis are unavailable. Implications for classroom-based assessment methodologies and future directions for research are discussed.Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

This review provides an overview and critical evaluation of the book, but it also extends its context by discussing the history of the treatment of mental illness and practices of the pharmaceutical-medical complex and by offering an optimistic scenario by which psychopharmacological agents will ultimately be replaced by interventions based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

Applying Behavior Analysis in Organizations: Organizational Behavior Management,"Abstract: Organizational behavior management (OBM) is the application of behavioral principles to individuals and groups in business, industry, government, and human service settings. OBM has its roots in the field of applied behavior analysis, which involves the application of operant and respondent procedures to produce socially significant change in human behavior. Modern OBM includes a number of subdisciplines such as performance management, systems analysis, and behavior-based safety. Its focus is on organizational problems such as lack of knowledge and skills, occupational injuries,productivity improvement, and quality deficits. This review provides a description of the theoretical and conceptual background of OBM, a brief history of the discipline, and a description of common topics and areas of applications.

The ABCs of incentive-based treatment  in health care: a behavior analytic framework to inform research and practice,"Course completion includes reading the Meredith et al., 2014 article and completing the 10 question quiz to 100% accuracy.Abstract: Behavior plays an important role in health promotion. Exercise, smoking cessation, medication adherence, and other healthy behavior can help prevent, or even treat, some diseases. Consequently, interventions that promote healthy behavior have become increasingly common in health care settings. Many of these interventions award incentives contingent upon preventive health-related behavior. Incentive-based interventions vary considerably along several dimensions, including who is targeted in the intervention, which behavior is targeted, and what type of incentive is used. More research on the quantitative and qualitative features of many of these variables is still needed to inform treatment. However, extensive literature on basic and applied behavior analytic research is currently available to help guide the study and practice of incentive-based treatment in health care. In this integrated review, we discuss how behavior analytic research and theory can help treatment providers design and implement incentive-based interventions that promote healthy behavior.Christen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University

Negative Effects of Positive Reinforcement,"Reading Perone's 2003 article and answering ASRs at 100%, the BACB certificant will be able toAbstract: Procedures classified as positive reinforcement are generally regarded as more desirable than those classified as aversive-those that involve negative reinforcement or punishment. This is a crude test of the desirability of a procedure to change or maintain behavior. The problems can be identified on the basis of theory, experimental analysis, and consideration of practical cases. Theoretically, the distinction between positive and negative reinforcement has proven difficult (some would say the distinction is untenable). When the distinction is made purely in operational terms, experiments reveal that positive reinforcement has aversive functions. On a practical level, positive reinforcement can lead to deleterious effects, and it is implicated in a range of personal and societal problems. These issues challenge us to identify other criteria for judging behavioral procedures. 1.5 Type 2 BACB CEUsChristen is the Founder and Executive Director of ABC.  Christen has established and assisted with the startup, and/or growth and development of four agencies providing ABA services.  She has supervised 100s of staff, including BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, and operations staff. She is a guest lecturer at Rutgers University
