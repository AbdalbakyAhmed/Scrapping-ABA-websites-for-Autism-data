Ruiz 2007 Scientific Culture of Behavior Analysis (2.5 Units - ETHICS),"Values and the Scientific Culture of Behavior Analysis (2.5 Units - ETHICS) As scientists and practitioners, behavior analysts must make frequent decisions that affect many lives. Scientific principles have been our guide as we work to promote effective action across a broad spectrum of cultural practices. Yet scientific principles alone may not be sufficient to guide our decision making in cases with potentially conflicting outcomes. In such cases, values function as guides to work through ethical conflicts. We will examine two ethical systems, radical behaviorism and functional contextualism, from which to consider the role of values in behavior analysis, and discuss potential concerns. Finally, we propose philosophical pragmatism, focusing on John Dewey's notions of community and dialogue, as a tradition that can help behavior analysts to integrate talk about values and scientific practices in ethical decision making.Values and the Scientific Culture of Behavior Analysis (2.5 Units - ETHICS) As scientists and practitioners, behavior analysts must make frequent decisions that affect many lives.

Turner et. al 2016 Supervision of ABA Trainees – 1 Supervision unit,"Turner et. al 2016 Supervision of ABA Trainees – 1 supervision unitAbstract Competency-based supervision of trainees has recently come to the forefront of behavior analytic practice; however, there are minimal data to support the effectiveness of various supervision practices on trainee outcomes. Accordingly, this paper is intended to spark further discussion and research activity regarding the supervision of those seeking to become Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA). We present a practice model and considerations for supervising applied behavior analytic trainees consistent with the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2012b), the Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2014), and extant literature from behavior analysis and related fields. Inherent to the current model is a focus on bidirectional feedback and collaboration between the supervisor and trainee to frequently evaluate the acceptability of the procedures, process, outcomes, and effectiveness of supervision. We present a Supervision Monitoring and Evaluation Form consistent with the current model and discuss the assumed importance of objective and subjective self-assessment of supervisor competence to the ultimate advancement of the practice of applied behavior analysis.Turner et. al 2016 Supervision of ABA Trainees – 1 supervision unitAbstract Competency-based supervision of trainees has recently come to the forefront of behavior analytic practice; however, there are minimal data to support the effectiveness of various supervision practices on trainee outcomes.

Forty-eight children diagnosed with ASD between 18 and 30 months of age were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups:Two years after entering intervention, the ESDM group on average improved 17.6 standard score points (1 SD: 15 points) compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline scores. The ESDM group maintained its rate of growth in adaptive behavior compared with a normative sample of typically developing children. In contrast, over the 2-year span, the comparison group showed greater delays in adaptive behavior. Children who received ESDM also were more likely to experience a change in diagnosis from autism to pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise speciﬁed, than the comparison group. This is the ﬁrst randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis.

This is the ﬁrst randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis.

Doughty 2007 Punished Stereotyped Behavior (2 Units),"Discriminative Control of Punished Stereotyped Behavior in Humans - (2 Units)The purpose of this experiment was to establish discriminative control of responding by an antecedent stimulus using differential punishment because the results of past studies on this topic have been mixed. Three adults with mental retardation who exhibited stereotypy not maintained by social consequences (i.e., automatic reinforcement) participated. For each subject, stereotypy occurred frequently in the presence of a stimulus correlated with nonpunishment of stereotypy and rarely, if ever, in the presence of a stimulus correlated with punishment of stereotypy. Latency measures showed that the antecedent stimulus correlated with punishment served as the discriminative stimulus for the suppression of stereotypy. These results are important in so far as they show that discriminative control by an antecedent stimulus develops with punishment, and because it sometimes may be desirable to establish such control of socially inappropriate behavior.Discriminative Control of Punished Stereotyped Behavior in Humans - (2 Units)The purpose of this experiment was to establish discriminative control of responding by an antecedent stimulus using differential punishment because the results of past studies on this topic have been mixed.

Mandell 2008 Psychotropic Medication Children with Autism (3 units),"Psychotropic Medication Use Among Medicaid-Enrolled Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders - (3 units) The objective of this study was to provide national estimates of psychotropic medication use among Medicaid-enrolled children with autism spectrum disorders and to examine child and health system characteristics associated with psychotropic medication use. This cross-sectional study used Medicaid claims for calendar year 2001 from all 50 states and Washington, DC, to examine 60 641 children with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Logistic regression with random effects was used to examine the child, county, and state factors associated with psychotropic medication use. Of the sample, 56% used at least 1 psychotropic medication, 20% of whom were prescribed 3 medications concurrently. Use was common even in children aged 0 to 2 years (18%) and 3 to 5 years (32%). Neuroleptic drugs were the most common psychotropic class (31%), followed by antidepressants (25%) and stimulants (22%). In adjusted analyses, male, older, and white children; those who were in foster care or in the Medicaid disability category; those who received additional psychiatric diagnoses; and those who used more autism spectrum disorder services were more likely to have used psychotropic drugs. Children who had a diagnosis of autistic disorder or who lived in counties with a lower percentage of white residents or greater urban density were less likely to use such medications. Psychotropic medication use is common among even very young children with autism spectrum disorders. Factors unrelated to clinical presentation seem highly associated with prescribing practices. Given the limited evidence base, there is an urgent need to assess the risks, benefits, and costs of medication use and understand the local and national policies that affect medication use.Psychotropic Medication Use Among Medicaid-Enrolled Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders - (3 units) The objective of this study was to provide national estimates of psychotropic medication use among Medicaid-enrolled children with autism spectrum disorders and to examine child and health system characteristics associated with psychotropic medication use.

After intervention, 75% of children who received behavior intervention (CR+ and BT groups) successfully tolerated PAP with increased hours of documented usage. This was in contrast to children whose families declined recommended behavior therapy (CR- group), of whom 0% increased their usage of PAP. High satisfaction ratings were obtained from referring physicians and patient caregivers for children in the CR+ and BT groups.

Morris 2009 Misrepresentation of ABA (Total Units 3 ETHICS),"A Case Study in the Misrepresentation of Applied Behavior Analysis in Autism: The Gernsbacher Lectures (Total Units 3 ETHICS)This article presents a case study in the misrepresentation of applied behavior analysis for autism based on Morton Ann Gernsbacher’s presentation of a lecture titled ‘‘The Science of Autism: Beyond the Myths and Misconceptions.’’ Her misrepresentations involve the characterization of applied behavior analysis, descriptions of practice guidelines, reviews of the treatment literature, presentations of the clinical trials research, and conclusions about those trials (e.g., children’s improvements are due to development, not applied behavior analysis). The article also reviews applied behavior analysis’ professional endorsements and research support, and addresses issues in professional conduct. It ends by noting the deleterious effects that misrepresenting any research on autism (e.g., biological, developmental, behavioral) have on our understanding and treating it in a transdisciplinary context.A Case Study in the Misrepresentation of Applied Behavior Analysis in Autism: The Gernsbacher Lectures (Total Units 3 ETHICS)This article presents a case study in the misrepresentation of applied behavior analysis for autism based on Morton Ann Gernsbacher’s presentation of a lecture titled ‘‘The Science of Autism: Beyond the Myths and Misconceptions.’’ Her misrepresentations involve the characterization of applied behavior analysis, descriptions of practice guidelines, reviews of the treatment literature, presentations of the clinical trials research, and conclusions about those trials (e.g., children’s improvements are due to development, not applied behavior analysis).

Bachmeyer 2009 Mealtime Behavior (2 Units),"Functional Analysis and Treatment of Multiply Controlled Inappropriate Mealtime Behavior (2 Units) bp2009 Functional analyses identified children whose inappropriate mealtime behavior was maintained by escape and adult attention. Function-based extinction procedures were tested individually and in combination. Attention extinction alone did not result in decreases in inappropriate mealtime behavior or a significant increase in acceptance. By contrast, escape extinction alone resulted in a decrease in inappropriate mealtime behavior and an increase in acceptance. However, inappropriate mealtime behavior did not decrease to clinically acceptable levels. A combined extinction technique (i.e., escape and attention extinction) resulted in a decrease in inappropriate mealtime behavior to clinically acceptable levels and high and stable acceptance.Functional Analysis and Treatment of Multiply Controlled Inappropriate Mealtime Behavior (2 Units) bp2009 Functional analyses identified children whose inappropriate mealtime behavior was maintained by escape and adult attention.
