Fundamentals of Telehealth in ABA," The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) increased their estimate of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to 1 in 59 children, and the CDC recognizes Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) as a notable treatment for ASD. However, many individuals do not receive intensive behavioral treatment due to limitations in healthcare reimbursement and an insufficient number of licensed or credentialed behavior analysts. These barriers to treatment are compounded for those living in rural areas. In response, a growing number of clinicians and researchers across fields are interested in a telehealth model of service delivery as a means to increase access to treatment. First, we reviewed therapeutic practices and areas of research to learn about current applications of telehealth for individuals with ASD. Second, we explored technological considerations for rendering services to families locally, rurally, or abroad. Last, we discussed compliance with guidelines and laws, protecting client health information, and ensuring ethical practice of ABA.",,,Imbueity,https://imbueity.com/supervision/continuing-education-ceus/,https://i1.wp.com/imbueity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Continuing-Education-at-Imbueity.png?fit=800%2C800&ssl=1,$25,1,Podcast,
